Important Items 
to Look for to 
Identify this 
Hazard   
• a stagnant vessel vapor 
space, and  
• trace amounts of 
flammable chemicals 
which could be 
released from the 
liquid.  
 
 
 Trace quantities of flammables can cause an event like this!   
Flammables in a vessel vapor space is a hazard present in many facilities .  In most cases, it is associated 
with handling flammable liquids; control systems include inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) padding, electrical 
grounding, hot work permit procedures, etc.  
 
But, a flammable vapor space can also develop in vessels which contain o nly TRACE amounts of 
flammable materials! Here are a few of the ways this could occur:  
• A reaction involving a chemical with trace quantities of a flammable material; when the main 
component is consumed in the reaction, these small quantities accumulate in the vessel’s vapor 
space, or  
• A liquid containing small quantities of soluble or entrained flammable impurities flows through a 
vessel, the flammable material is released and trapped in the vapor space, or  
• Adsorption of a liquid which contains trace quantit ies of a non absorbed flammable impurity which 
can be left to accumulate in the vapor space.  
 
What To Do If You Have This Hazard   
• treat the vessel as if it held a flammable material  
• install a purging flow in the vapor space to maintain a flammable concentration less 
that 25% of the lower explosive limit

Snow and Ice Hazards – they can cause more than 
slips and falls!   
For many of us, it’s that time of the year again!  
 
Snow and ice build -ups on equipment and buildings can have undesirable 
consequences when they finally  decide to fall.  Damage can include 
bent/broken sections of tubing, small piping and cable trays; injury to 
personnel can occur if someone is in the area at the time.  But, did you know 
snow and ice “slides” have opened valves?  
 
 
INCIDENT DESCRIPTION   
A release of material occurred from a ¾” drain valve on piping connected to an atmospheric storage tank.  
How the valve opened was unknown.  The incident was investigated; a theory was developed that melting 
snow slid from the top of the tank and landed on the straight handle of a ¼ turn ball valve - and this caused 
the valve to open.  There were skeptics – and more than one!  So, the investigation team carried a bucket of 
snow to the top of the tank and let it slide in the direction of the valve.  The theory was proven! - Snow 
falling from the top of the tank can open a ¾”, “straight handle” ball valve.  
 
In a similar situation at another facility, a mass of ice broke away from  a structure and landed on a similar ¼ 
turn straight handle condenser drain valve.  Again, release of material followed.  
ACTIONS 
TAKEN    
These incidents prompted 
a review of the plant’s 
piping and valve 
installation practices.  
Modifications were made, 
drain valves were installed 
in the vertical position, 
lever -style (straight) 
handles must be installed 
such that the valve is 
opened by pulling up on 
the lever, not by pushing 
down.  Circular style 
handles offer similar 
protection.  LESSONS LEARNED   
 
Snow and ice build -up represent significant hazards – for a number of 
reasons.  While the consequences in most cases will not be major, there is 
potential for events of concern.  Obviously, the best preventive measure is 
installation of equipment that will not allow snow or ice to accumulate.  
Where this is unsuccessful, controlled removal (e.g., carefully cut small 
pieces with steam and allow them to safely fall to grade) is an action to 
consider.  When this cannot be done, precautions should be taken which 
limit damage when the material eventually does fall to grade.  
Also, inadvertent operation of ¼ turn drain valves has occurred in many 
facilities, this example is for falling snow/ice.  Other causes include :  
inadvertent contact with moving objects (hoses, peo ple, ladders or 
materials), vibration, etc.  Experience indicates that round handles are an 
effective means to prevent a number of releases.  Many locations have also 
adopted a practice of installing a mechanical plug (or blind flange) in all 
valve opening s, which could allow release of a hazardous material.  December 2001

 Every year, hundre ds of equipment 
items are damaged in an explosion.  
These events are often described in 
familiar terms:  
 
??a flammable vapor, air and an 
ignition source generate 
pressure,  
??which ruptures 
piping/buildings/equipment (like 
these column trays),  
??leading to proper ty damage, 
downtime, lost business and, in 
some cases, serious injury or 
death to personnel in the 
immediate area.  
 
Most flammable materials have a flammable range, a concentration of the flammable 
material in air, which will support combustion.  If the c oncentration of the substance is 
above or below these “flammable limits”, combustion will not occur.  Please recognize that 
these values depend upon a number of variables, including the material itself, the pres sure, 
and the oxygen concentration . There are  many ways to prevent explosions - this message 
will BRIEFLY discuss one :  How much flammable material 
is needed to generate an explosion?   The short answer is - in 
most cases, LESS THAN YOU MIGHT THINK!  
Let’s go take a fairly simple example – PROPANE, a material 
many of us have in our home B -B-Q grills.  How much propane 
is needed to fill a 2 -car garage (say 20’ by 20’ by 10’) to its 
lower flammable limit?   Propane’s flammable limits in ambient 
conditions are between 2.3% and 9.5% (by volume) in air (ref:   
SAX, 9th edition).  SO…. 
        -garage volume = 20 * 20 * 10 = 4000 ft3  
        -lower explosive limit amount = 2.3% * 4000 ft3 = 92 ft3  
         of propane vapor  
        -which is equivalent to about 3 gallons of liquid – 
Answer:  NOT MUCH!  In a typi cal manufacturing site, 
flammable materials are 
handled in hundreds or 
thousands of gallons.  It is 
obvious that careful control is 
needed for these materials.  
Very small quantities, even 
those involved with valve 
leakage, can generate events 
which have v ery severe 
consequences!  January  2002

Things to consider to prevent equipment damage from vacuum:  
 
• install a system to provide vacuum relief .  As one of the pictures graphically 
demonstrates, railcars and trucks MAY NOT have this equipment. These 
devices will allow air to enter the vessel and prevent vacuum formation.  
• if installed, vacuum relief devices must be inspected and tested on a regula r 
basis.  They are just as critical as pressure relief devices.  
• understand which vessels in your department are not rated for full vacuum.  
These are the vessels vulnerable to vacuum related incidents,  
• demonstrate caution whenever liquids are transferred o r vapors are condensed 
because of shutdown, maintenance, cleaning, etc..  
• be sure that the addition of air, nitrogen, or other vacuum breaking materials 
are not impeded.  VACUUM is a powerful force!  
COMMON causes of vacuum damage to tanks include:   
• The ves sel has insufficient strength to withstand a vacuum; a vessel with a 50 
psig (or higher) ASME pressure rating is frequently capable of withstanding a 
full vacuum;  
 
• vacuum is created when liquid is transferred from a vessel or when hot vapor  
condenses, ne ither of which is replaced by air/nitrogen or other non -
condensable material, and  
 
• a vacuum relief system is not present or is not functioning properly.   
Here’s what 
happened……  
 
When steam cleaning 
the interior of a railcar 
most of the air was 
displaced. When work 
was stopped at the end 
of the day all valves 
were closed. As the car 
cooled, the steam 
condensed, creating a 
vacuum, causing the 
railcar to collapse  
 
During painting, a tank’s 
vacuum relief valve was 
covered with plastic to 
prevent potential 
contamination of the 
contents. When liquid 
was pumped out the 
plastic covering 
prevented air/nitrogen 
from replacing the liquid 
volume. A vacuum 
developed leading to the 
partial collapse of the 
tank. WHENEVER vacuum relief systems are removed, covered, modifi ed, 
etc., special precautions are needed to prevent an incident ! February 2002

LAYERS OF PROTECTION
YYYooouuu   NNNEEEEEEDDD   TTThhheeemmm   
HERE’S WHAT HAPPENED…… 
 
During a non-routine procedure, materials 
were transferred into a vessel.  A number of items were present (i.e., “layers of protection”) to prevent vessel damage, including: 
• A high pressure alarm (in this case, 
the alarm was acknowledged earlier when it was assumed to be caused by a faulty instrument) 
•  A pressure control system which 
allows pressure to be vented to another system in the area (in this 
case, this “second system” was out of 
service), and 
• A pressure relief/vacuum system 
which vented to the atmosphere (this system contained a flame arrestor which was found to be plugged). 
• The net result of all these failures was 
a ruptured roof on the tank 
 
What can I do to protect equipment? 
• NEVER  assume an alarm is functioning improperly -if an alarm becomes a 
nuisance, take immediate steps to have it repaired; 
• Review alarm status for equipment early in your shift, understand why ALL  
alarms are present; 
• Pressure/vacuum relief valves are often the LAST  line of defense which prevents 
vessel damage, maintenance systems must be in place to properly test these devices; 
• Pluggage in vent lines must be managed - if a line has a tendency to plug, cleaning 
frequencies should be adjusted to main tain the line in a “clean” state; and 
• Non-routine operations often have fewer or weaker layers of protection when 
compared with “routine” operations, all items preventing equipment damage are especially critical.
 What do layers of protection accomplish? 
• A well designed facility includes multiple items of protection for equipment; 
• These frequently include a number of the following: operato r monitoring, procedures, alarms, interlocks, pressure 
rated equipment and relie f/vacuum valves, and 
• In most cases, multiple systems must  fail before vessel damage occurs

How’d that happen ? 
Compressed gas cy linders have an enor mous amount of stored

….AND HE BLEW THE HOUSE DOWN 
 
What is an explosion? 
There ar e lots of  definitions, 
but the explosion above 
resulted fro m a basic 
combustion process.   
There were three steps: 
• 
• 
• release of a com bustible 
material (hydrogen in 
this c ase) 
accum ulation of that 
material in a “cloud”, 
and then 
an ignition source 
provides the “spark” for 
combustion. 
Obviously, the larger the 
accum ulation, the la rger the 
explosion!  
So, w hat do you do? 
In this incident, a good ventilati on system  woul d likely dilute the sm all amounts of escaping hydrogen to 
maintain a concentration below the lower flammable limit – “dilution is the solution”!  Indoor battery 
charging operations MU ST take hydrogen generation rates into account, and an  appropriately designed 
ventilation system  installed, operated and m aintained. What about hydrogen? 
Hydrogen is an interesting gas, it is  very “light” (it will rise quite 
rapid ly in a ir) and has a very wide r ange of  flamm ability.  A large 
number of hydrocarbons are com bustible in a range of 2-15%;  
hydrogen is com bustible in a range of 4-74% (by volum e), which is 
very wide by com parison.  Also, the am ount of e nergy required to 
ignite a hydrogen cloud is very low.  These properties, in m any 
respects, m ake hydrogen an ideal m aterial for explosions in areas 
where it can  be confined . Here’s wh at 
happened… 
The pictu re here is the typical 
result of an event that happens 
hundreds of tim es every year 
– an explosion  
 
In this case, the “fuel” w as 
believed to be hydrogen 
generated from  the computer 
backup battery charging 
system  seen in the 
background.   Ventilation  of 
this r elatively sm all portion of  
the 50,000 square foot 
building was either not 
working or poorly designed.  
The sm all amounts of 
hydrogen released during the 
battery charging operation 
apparently accum ulated and 
then an ignition source led to 
the explosion.  As you can 
see, the roof was blown off 
(about 400 square feet), the 
damage is extensive - but, no 
one was in the building so – 
luckily - no injuries.  A 
typical event, happens all the 
time! 
Whenever  a flammable substance is presen t in a confined area, release 
of that mat erial creates a potential explosion scenario. May 2002

The Seal That 
Didn’t Perform! 
 Here’s W hat Happened:  
The pum p in this picture was d estroy ed because the mechanic al 
seal fail ed.  The light hydrocarbon being pum ped was released; it 
ignited and burned – causi ng extensive l ocal dam age.  No one was 
near the pump when the fire occurre d, so there were n o injuries. 
 
 
What can I do?  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• When you walk through ar eas, alway s be alert for liquids 
around pum ps.  Liquid presence may mean a seal leak. 
Operate the pum p the way  it was designed to function.  For 
instance, if the seal has a barrier fluid or seal purge, make 
sure there is f luid in the reservoir and tha t it is flowing to the 
pump.  Understanding thes e special sy stem s and their proper 
operation will extend seal life and m inimize failures. 
Never ‘dead head’  (no liquid flow) a pum p.  Pumps and seals 
can heat significantly  when there is no liquid flow.  This can 
lead to a number of unwanted consequences, including seal 
failure. 
During m aintenance activit ies, be sure the installed se al is 
made of the c orrect materials. 
When you detect a leaking seal, take the pump out of s ervice 
prom ptly and get it repaired.  Seal leaks quickly  get worse 
with time.  What is a Seal ? 
(Hint: We are not talki ng about  
the circus!) 
Many , probably most, pum ps have some 
type of m echanical se al.  In GENERAL  
terms, it is a device which prevents 
significant leakage of the fluids in pumps 
and other powered machi nery items.  
Seals co me in a num ber of different 
designs and a wide array  of different 
materi als of construction.  While the 
function of a mechanic al seal is relative ly 
simple, sel ecting the correct seal for a 
given applica tion requires j udgm ent and 
experience. 
 
Why do they Leak?  
Nothing com plicated here: 
1) they wear out, 
2) they are not installed corre ctly,  
3) they are not o perated properly, or 
4) they are made of wrong materials. 
 
Leakage rates can be very significan t 
with som e types of failures!

anything t hat looks abnorm al – it may be a WEAK POINT in your system ! Comm on causes of failures 
like this: 
• 
• 
• threaded connections can be 
weak points, especially  if the 
threads are co rroded, stripped 
or if the threaded connection is

was the fa ct that someone was

therm owell when the joint 
failed 
 
What can I do? 
• 
• 
• 
• While com plete failures of joints are rare, they can 
and do occur.  In this incident, the force on the 
therm owell was approximately  1-3/4 ton, and the 
failure propelled the thermowell at roughl y 90 
MPH.  When increasing pressure in equipment 
attempt to sta nd a safe distance aw ay or behind 
barricades until the final pressure is reached. 
Whenever threaded connections are disasse mbled, 
inspect BOT H sets of thre ads for corrosion, signs 
of cross threa ding, etc.  If there is a proble m, get it 
repaired before putting pressure on the joint. 
Threaded connections can be “backweld ed” - this 
will i mprove the overall strength of t he joint.  T he 
disadvantage, of course, is now the join t can not be 
disasse mbled easily . 
For sy stem s where significant corrosion is present, 
flanged conn ections are generally  better than 
threaded.The p ictures are made av ailable b y the compan y invol ved to impr ove safety  awareness across th e industr y. August 2002"

with hazardous  chem icals, these include: 
• 
• 
• American C hemistry Counci l (AC C) has 
adde d a Security Code t o Responsible 
Care; other trade groups are taking 
similar steps, 
CCPS has  published a document 
descri bing how to c onduct a Security 
Vulnerability Analysis (SVA).  This 
method, or one which is similar, ca n be 
used to assess  your site’s security ris ks.  
ACC sites m ust complete th is task  prior

A num ber of  groups are offering training 
classes on iss ues im pacting chem ical site 
security.   What can I do? 
 
Be alert!  Kno w who is in your area a nd why 
they are t here.  Watch for out-of-place objects 
- a clean , orderly facility makes this easier to 
accom plish.  
Be aware!  Take t ime to tour your workplace.  
ACTIVEL Y look for unusual items or pe ople 
– if you see a nything that seems out  of place 
notify manage ment or your securi ty group. 
Be informed !  Understand  and follow y our 
location’s sec urity practices.  Pay special 
attention t o your site access c ontrol system .  
Everyone should follow th ese ru les on  site, 
including visitors and contractors.  
Be smart !  The  world can be a very 
unfriendly place - Sept ember 11  tragically 
demonstrated this to all people worldwide.  
We, a s individuals, must be suspicious of 
actions a nd things around us. 
Be ESPECIALLY cautious in areas that  contain very hazardous materials.  
Anything unusual in these areas should be r eported immediately.

It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s………………A PUMP! 
 
   
 
The Incident 
A 75 HP cent rifugal pu mp was ope rated  with both suction and di scharg e valves closed for a bout 45 
minutes.  It was beli eved to be com pletely full of li quid.  As mecha nical e nergy from the moto r was 
transfe rred to  heat, the liquid in the pum p slo wly incr eased in temp eratu re and pressu re until finally - 
the pump fail ed cata strophically.  One fragment we ighing 5 po unds was foun d over 400 feet away.  
Luckily, no on e wa s in the area so the re were n o injuries. 
 
Why w ould events such  as this 
happen? 
• 
• 
• 
• • 
• 
• 
• 
• This situ ation  is differen t than op erating  a 
pump “dea dheaded”  – where the suction 
valve is op en but there is no flow throug h the 
pump.  Here, pressure relief o ccurs  back 
through the pum p suction line. 
In the past, this event likely would have  
ende d with a seal failure - seal leakage  would 
have  been sufficient to relieve the pres sure.  
New seal designs a re significa ntly im proved. 
This older “reli ef system ” can no longe r be 
counted upo n. 
As processes  have becom e more automated it 
is now m uch easier to ac cidentally start a 
pump or operat e the wrong va lve. 
Spare pump arrangem ents can als o be a 
problem  if the “incorrect” pump is started.  
For e xample, the “ north pump” has val ves 
aligned for operatio n but the “so uth pump” is 
started.  
   
What can I do? 
If you disc over a “bl ocked in” pum p in 
operation, use ext reme caution.  Shut the 
pump down remotely; keep people FAR  
away un til it has coo led. 
Use care whe n starting pum ps.  
Communication about which pum p is 
valved for ope ration must be very clear. 
Some plants try to have an individual 
near th e pump when it is started .  This 
may n ot be possible in all situatio ns, but 
it can  elimin ate m any problems. 
If possible, open the casing drain on a 
pump that will b e out of serv ice fo r an 
extended pe riod.  But, chec k to make sure  
you are not creating another problem 
(environm ental, cost, etc) by doing s o! 
And, a routine tour of a manufact uring 
area ca n identify many things – a blocke d 
in pump operation is ju st one of them! 
Pumps move li quids for us every day, but they can also generate 
heat – a signifi cant hazard i f it has no place to go!

WHAT HAS YOUR STEAM UP 
The Incident: 
At first glance, this appears to be a traffic incident  – but take a closer look! You are looking at  a process 
safety  event.  The phot os gr aphically  explain what happe ns when HOT asphalt is added into a t railer that has 
been recently cleaned with water.  Unfortunately, the excess water is not rem oved from  the tra iler before 
adding t he asphalt - the water rapidl y turns to steam  and expands i n volum e about 160 0 tim es.  The result - 
significant damage. In this case it’ s a tan ker, but it coul d just as easi ly have happe ned to a vessel or piping 
system .  No i njuries occurred. 
 
   
Common Causes of fa ilures like this: 
This t ype of e vent has happ ened MANY  times, often involvi ng heat transfer  fluids, mineral oils or other 
“heavy ” orga nic materials (like the asphalt above).  T he event begi ns when a HOT material is added to a 
vessel or piping which contains materials with a boiling point unde r the te mperature of the hot material.  In 
general, the larger the difference betw een the te mperature of the h ot material an d the boi ling point of the 
lower boiling material, the more significant the damage.  As heat is transferred from  the hotter materi al, 
vaporization of the lower boiling m aterial occurs and the pressure that results can cause lots of da mage!  
 
What Can I do? 
5 
5 
5 
5 During ANY  materi al transfer, if the liquid being transfe rred is hotter than 21 2F/100C – take st eps to 
make certain there is no water in the dow nstream  equipment. 
Water rem oval is often dif ficult in comp lex pipi ng system s:  Low point drains MUST  be opened, 
piping m ust be carefully  examined for “tra ps” and flanges may  need to be opened in MANY  
locations. 
Shipping containers are fr equently  cleaned with wa ter; any shipping container must be assu med to 
contain water  unless steps have been taken to rem ove it. 
Proceed slow ly when starting up processes following shutdowns, e specially  with fluids that are very  
hot. 
HOT liquids have many ha zards!  Don’t forget they can lead to significant pressure buildup if 
added to vessels con taining w ater or other materia ls with boiling poin ts low er than the 
tempera ture of the hot fluid.

Security – It’s everybody’s Job  
 
After the attacks on Septem ber 11, 20 01, when our  
nation' s leaders told us ""to remain vigilant"", the y were 
speaking to all of us. We ha ve heard that che mical plants 
may be attractive targets for terrorists due to their 
potentiall y large impacts on neighb oring communities, 
or by  theft of chemicals.  That makes us the front line of 
defense.  The m ore watchf ul we all are, the greater 
chance that s uspicious behavior can be spotted - and 
stopped - bef ore harm  can be done. We are not anti-
terroris m experts but we ca n do a lot to protect 
ourselves, our co mpanies, and our com munities.  
These are difficult times. Our past pract ices and procedures may  no longer address 
the new  concerns raised b y terrorist at tacks. America has met these challenges in 
the past through the attention a nd determina tion of people just like y ou. Keep y our 
eyes open , and if something doesn’t a ppear to be c orrect – ASK!

Here is a quick  list: 
All co mpanies have securit y policies and practi ces – understand them , and practice them . Wear your 
employee bad ge, and no te that your cow orkers do the same. When you “badge i n” do n ot allo w others 
to “tailgate” in on your pass. Park onl y where allowed.  
As you make your i nspection rounds, ke ep your eyes open for potential weaknesses in the plant’ s 
security . Look for any thing out of place or different. Point these deficiencie s out to your supe rvisor or 
the security  depart ment.  
Review y our plant’ s emergency procedures – evacuati on, em ergenc y response, etc. 
Pay attentio n to the require d paperwork for contr actors and visitors. If it doesn’ t appear correc t, 
contact your supervisor.  Be particularly  alert to new bulk shi pment drivers. 
Housekeeping is a never-ending  part of operations. If a plant is kept neat there ar e fewer pla ces to 
hide som ething and sm all leaks can be e asily  detected and cleaned up before the y become lar ger 
hazards. 
Check in-coming shipm ents for proper ta mper seals. If the y are missing, notif y the proper pe rson. 
That load m ay have been contam inated, or some of  the contents stolen on the way to your l ocation. 
Make sure all  deliveries ar e handled according to your location’ s procedures – especially  thos e 
arriving o utside norm al receiving h ours.  
Be careful what inform ation you share with people outside your c ompany. A lo t of confident ial 
inform ation can be lost to s omeone who is overly  curious . Som e of these people will use the nam es of 
plant m anagers and others to  appear to be trustworthy . 
 
Report any  and all strange phone calls recei ved to y our supervisor. Follow ing 9/11  
several chemical pla nts received questionabl e calls inquiring about their operations. 
Don’t be embarrassed to raise an y questions  if you notice something different.  We 
would all prefer to be safe than sorr y. Messages for  Manufacturing Personnel

Check the Clearance 
 
Many plants are required to perfor m on-line m aintenance or construc tion using large scale tools and 
equipm ent (cranes, hoists, bundle pullers, welding m achin es, vacuum  trucks). The transport and 
operation of such equipm ent onto operating plant s ites can pos e a sign ificant risk and r esult in 
acciden ts unless s teps are taken to make su re that process facilities are secure.

Follow ing are some key  safety considerations: 
 
► 
► 
► 
► 
► 
► Check that adequate sp ace is allocated when moving construction equipm ent onto a plant site. 
Check clearances on overhead power lines, instrum ent conduits and pipe racks.  
 
Pre-plan all turns and en sure that con struction equipm ent does not strike people, process 
equipm ent, or areas where workers g ather. 
 
Take large mobile equipm ent ap art into sm aller com ponents when possible before transit.  
Never tr avel with the jib assem bled on a tall cran e. 
 
Always trav el at a slow speed  and have a groundsm an or signalm an walk ahead of the load. 
 
Pay particular attention to the wind effect s on m oving suspended lo ads an d take a ll the 
necessary precautions. 
 
Remember that long loads are highly suscep tible to grade changes or ground conditions. A 
slight dip or rise in the ro ad of a few inches m ay cause a boom to swing several feet.   
 
Make sure that equipment is securely positioned before use and 
that it will not strike people, equipment or buildings.

Here’s What Happened:
A ther mally unstable  materi al (a pe roxide -- but many che micals have  similar properties) was  
being fed fr om a weigh tank to a r eactor.  Nor mal pra ctice is toempty the weigh tank, leaving 
the tr ansfer piping e mpty.  In this instance, a leak developed. A qui ck repair was expect ed so 
valves were  closed l eaving the  pipe  FULL of peroxide.  The reactor temper ature  was well 
above  the point at whi ch the  peroxi de decomposes .  Heat fr om the reactor slowly warmed the 
material in the piping as the repa ir effort c ontinued past the  expe cted c ompletion ti me.  The  
material finally reached its deco mposition temperat ure.  The result--ove rpressure that ruptured 
the piping.   Luckily, the re were no i njuries, just a lot of surprised people . 
What Can I Do?
This incident is a great e xample of how things ca n go wrong!
•You m ust be constantly a ware of te mperature when 
handling thermally sensitive materials
•Blocking in unstable ma terials oft en invites an inc ident
•Repairs can cause abnor mal operations and new haz ards
•If a ma terial can be he ated to its de composition point, 
special procedures and precautions are needed
•Heat can come from  almost anywhere, including 
conne cted equipment, the sun, heat t racing, me chanical 
energy, wel ding and… 
How  Do I Know  If I Have

This terminal had just started storing large 
quantit ies of fl ammable liquids.  Activa ted 
carbon drum s were used in the ve nt syste m 
to control hydrocarbon e missions and odors.  
Each tank was to have a flame arrestor and a 
foam fire protect ion syste m, but they were  
not install ed be fore fill ing t he tanks.  
Suddenly, there was an explosion and a fire.  
Emergency response personnel arrived, 
residents living ne arby were eva cuated, and 
fire fighting and e mergency control started. 
It took 3 days to put the fire out and dea l 
with other i ssues such as contaminated fire 
water run off and spill age from other  tanks.
What Went Wrong?
There are many causes of this accident,  
but let’s f ocus on the f ire triangle.
All three components o f the “Fire 
Triangle ” (heat, fuel and oxygen) were 
present. Let’s see how that happene d:
•FuelFuel came from the o rganic materials  in 
the vessel vapor space;
•OxygenOxygen came from the air in the 
vessel vapor space (the vessels  
were not nit rogen blanketed) and,  
•the only re maining 
component needed to start 
the f ire was HeatHeat . Did it  
come from a loose 
electrical connect ion, stati c 
electricity, or hot work?

Check out  the EPA  alert on carbon drums at http://www. epa.gov/swer cepp/pubs/carb- ads.pdf•When organic ma terials pass through

that can cause significant amounts of he at to be  
genera ted.  In fact, the carbon got so hot tha t 
it reached the autoign ition temperature of 
the tan k vent gas.  That was the “spark ” that 
led to this explosion!
•A few autoignition temperatur es you m ight

A“GOOD IDEA” CANTURN BAD . . . 
WHEN YOUIGNORE MANAGEMENT OFCHANGE !Here’s What Happened:
A mechanic was drainin g oil from this 
large gear  box.  The o il was draini ng 
out very slowly, so he decided to 
speed the job up  by connecting  an air  
hose to  push the  oil out faste r.  It didn’t 
take long f or the  results shown  to 
happen.   The cast  iron  gear  box 
fractured , blowing a large piece off and 
onto the floor. For tunately, no  one was 
hurt.
Why Did This Hap pen?
•The gear b ox was not a pressure  
vessel
•More air was added than could  be 
vented,  so the pre ssure  built up
•MOC was not u sed to revie w the 
change 
What Can You Do?
•Many piece s of equipment  in a  
chemical pla nt are NOT designed 
for p ressure.  Check the 
equipment folder, but if there is 
no ASME code stamp , assume  
that it is no t pressu re rated.
•Adding air to the gear box was a  
change and should  have been 
checked through the site’s MOC 
process.   
•Be alert to  subtle changes tha t 
might no t be safe.Here’s What Shoul d Happen:
Good ideas improve operations and reduce  
risk every day.   Ho wever, before 
implementin g a good idea, it is essential to 
revie w the change to  ensure that it doesn’t  
introduce  any new hazards or  risks to the 
workplace.  In this incident , the  mechanic  
should have  recognized what he  was abou t 
to do  as “no t like-in-kind ” and revie wed the 
change thro ugh the  MOC process.   This 
would have identified th at the gear  box was  
not designed for pressu re.

it discharges.  
This is a static el ectrical spark!! This is a static el ectrical spark!!
•These bead s con tained  trace amounts of pen tane, a 
volatile flammable material.  As the beads fell, some 
of the pen tane vapori zed and made the atmosp here  
flammable.
•The air purge that w as su ppose to sw eep the 
flammables  out of the sieve w as not working 
properly.  This critical safety system failed—too 
little air flow allowed a flamma ble atmos phere to 
develop!
•The purge air flow system w as not interlocked to  
the sieve operation so  no alarm sou nded at low air

Here’s Wh at Happened:
A very si mple job— fill the tank with 
water.  This is a common occurrence at 
a ma nufac turing plan t and has mini mal 
hazards.  In this case, site personnel  
were being extra cau tious. They sta rted 
the water f low and conf irmed that air 
was coming out of the vent on top of 
the tank. Everything see med to be 
fine…BUTBUT , the source of  the water 
was the pl ant fire water system ---and 
the f low was VERYVERY high!  The vent  
did not have  enough c apacity to relieve 
all of the di splaced air, pressu re built 
up in the tank, and BOOMBOOM —the t op 
blew off when the roof seam fail ed.
Liqui d transfer can lead to major vessel damage.  
“Transfer rate” must no t exceed “vent capacity.”How  Did This Ha ppen ?
Tank vents are usual ly sized to handl e nor mal 
processing activi ties, such as pum ping in to or out of 
the t ank during product transfers.  Venting and 
vacuum break capaci ties are deter mined using  
formulas, or enginee ring c alculations.  These 
calculations are oft en call ed the “vent system design 
basis.”
Proble ms occur when the inflow or outflow of liquid is 
great er than the capaci ty of the  vent syste m.  For 
inflow, it leads to an increase of pressu re inside the 
tank be cause the vapor can’t get out  fast enough.  
It doesn’t take much pressure (in some  cases just a few 
inches of water) to cause a lot of da mage.  Tanks 
usually have large surfac e are as, so when pounds per 
square inch is m ultiplied by a large num ber of  square 
inches, the forc e can be huge!  In this case, the roof 
seam was the we ak point and fai led first.  Don’t pop your top…CENTER FOR

If uncertain---CHECK!

there are m any times that a vessel 
must be filled with water.  Each

The pictur e on the i mmedi ate left

different!                 
WHY?WHY?
The Facts:
¾The rota meter was rated for 175 psig at 200oF.  
At 360oF, the rating drops to only 80 psig.  Steam 
used to cle ar the plug wa s 150 psig and 360o F.

However, it  was practi ced “un-offic ially” during

What You Can Do to Keep Your Pl ant Safe in an Electri cal Outage
•ResearchResearch —Make sure you know this …
•Find out which instruments and equipment are on the emer gency power system and which ones are
not.  Know how to compensa te for the contro ls tha t will be lost.
•Review the operating instructions of the emer gency power system.  Know how long it is expected to
operate. If you have an em ergency gene rator, ma ke sure you have operating instructions, fuel and
any other it ems needed for its operation. 
•Know the power off-fail position of key i nstruments and equipment.  Most are pro bably designed to
go to a “fail-safe position,” but f or those t hat are no t, you shoul d have instructions on w hat to do.
•PreplanPreplan —Think throu gh what you would do…
•Think abou t the 1st, 2nd and 3 rd thing s you would immedi ately doif the power fa iled.  Make s ure
these things take care of p otential emerge ncies and that the plant is safe.
•Know the calls and notification s that you need to make and know how to make them q uickly.
•Review your emer gency res ponse plan and emergency procedures for actions to be taken.
•Accidents can occur duri ng resta rt aft er a power outage.  K nowthe safe restart procedure!
•PracticePractice —Walk and talk through what needs t o be done…
•Talk with your co workers  about w hat they would  do and why.  Develop a common p lan for
response to power failures.  Know how to respond when  all alarms sound at once.
•If you can, conduct o r participa te in powe r failure dr ills including the testing  of emergency
generators.  If this  is not possible, men tally wal k through powe r fail ure actions .The Electri city just went off… The Electri city just went off…

An emplo yee was assigned to 
sample the atmosphere  in a reactor  
by using a  flexib le hose equipped 
with a  rubbe r hand  pum p.  To do so, 
he went  to the open  top man  way 
and was later  found  dead . The 
reactor  ha d been  opened fo r 
catalyst  unloading and was being 
purged with nit rogen.   While the 
cause  of this accident  has not  been  
positive ly determined,  it is quite  
possible th at nitrogen  exiting the 
vessel ov ercam e (asph yxiated)  the 
emplo yee.
We a ll recognize the haz ard of enteri ng a confined  
spac e with an atmosp here containing a low oxyge n 
level, but we should also rem ember that ….
While purgi ng an open  vesse l:
¾Be aware t hat possible oxygen deficient a reas 
can extend  beyond a co nfined space,  especially 
during initial  gas testing  and monitoring o f a vessel.  
¾If there  are any doub ts, use a self contained 
breathing ap paratu s and an observer  to call for help,
if needed , when working  near  purged equipment  
openings. – This is espe cially true  for emergency 
responders to a possible asphyxiatio n acciden t.
¾Control a ccess to the poten tially dangerous area, 
post Danger Signs at vessel openings,  and use a 
Safe-to -Work permitting system  that includes a sign-
in/sign-out  log system  separate  from the Confined 
space log .Since nitro gen is a  colorless, od orless 
gas that does not provide any indication  
of danger , it is truly an  invisible hazar d.
Air normally contains approximately 
20.8%  oxygen.   However  reducing  that 
level just a little reduces a  person’s 
ability to  function. 
Atmospheres with less than 19½% 
oxygen are defined by OSHA as “oxygen 
deficient” and can be fatal over  a 
relativel y short  period o f time.  
Norma l bre athing is controlled by the 
amount o f carbon dioxide in the body.  
Excess exposure to nitrogen can replace 
the carbon  dioxide and  cause  breathing  
to stop  com pletely.

•Look aro und the area wh ere the h ot work wi ll be pe rformed and do a 
thorough gas check of al l potent ial sourc es---not just the obvious ones .  
Use extra care when check ing in or near sm all enc losures (like the  one

•If your job duties include using gas d etection equ ipment, you should 
have been trained in its us e.  R emem ber, equipm ent must be calibrated

•Look aro und the work area for so urces of f lammable m aterial and be 
aware of an y strange odor.  Rem ember, you will be supplying the

•Ask the ope rator exac tly where a  gas test was perform ed. If one was 
not done,  insist that it be done.  If it did not cove r all potential source 
areas, i nsist that a retes t be done.A welder was grinding near

Evaluate EveryEvery change, even Tempor ary on es—for Expected and UnexpectedUnexpected Cons equences 
Flixborough—30 Years Ago…
Why this Happened
The tempor ary modifi cation was not ad equat ely 
review ed for potential adverse conse quences!
•The temporar y bypass was mad e with two be nds in it  
because the nozzles on  the two tanks wer e at d ifferent leve ls.  
The impact of internal forces and flow str esses w ere not  
considered on the expansion bellows .
•Expansion bel lows w ere left in plac e on each end of the 
bypass l ine.  T he suitability of this design  and  man ufacturer ’s 
recommendat ions were n ot considered.                            
•The weight  of t he temporar y bypas s was not secure ly 
supported—it was simply placed on scaffo lding.  The amount  
of movement and the effect of  that move ment on the bellows 
were not consider ed.                                         
•Always follo w your company’ s  Managem ent of Change 
(MO C) pr ocedure.  Remember, tem porary changes 
dem and the same rigoro us review as do permanen t 
changes.  If you do not util ize a MOC procedure, discuss 
the value it c ould provide t o your fac ility.
•Make changes only after thor ough hazard revi ews have 
been cond ucte d and ap proved b y qualified experts.
•Use good engineer ing pra ctices and manufactur er’s 
recommendations.

How  Did this Hap pen?What You Can DoThis TFE l ined stainless steel expansio n 
joint was part of a piping syste m 
conta ining a high conc entration of  HCl. 
The expans ion joint was not installed 
properly and HCl had embrittled the 
stainless steel bellows. This embrittlement 
along with fat igue ca used by improper 
alignment and insuf ficient restraint caused 
the joint to fai l. The c atastrophic fa ilure 
you see in this picture  occurred the day 
after it passed a visual inspection. 
Fortunately, the syste m pressure was low , 
the leak was s mall, and no one was around 
when it fai led.  In this case, there were no  
injuries. However, if  the circum stances 
had be en only slightly di fferent…Misalignment + Corrosion = Failure!
•The piping to the vessel where     
this expansion joint was u sed was  
misal igned by approxima tely ¾ i nch.  
This caused stress on the expansi on 
joint.
•The three retaining bolts that limi t 
compression and ext ension were  not 
installed on the expansion joint 
because of space l imitat ions.  This 
allow ed excessive m ovement and 
placed even mor e stres s on the joint.
•The specification f or this joint had 
changed during a retrofit  of the process 
for a new chemi cal service, but t he 
expansion joint was not repla ced with 
one of prope r specifi cation, requiring a 
higher grade of stainl ess.  This likely 
contribut ed to the HCl embrittleme nt 
of the stainl ess steel ma king it prone to 
stress cracking and failure.•Expansion joints are precision engineered equipment  
and MUST be install ed correct ly!
•Ensure t hat all e quipment  is installe d per 
manuf acturer’ s specif ications!!! U se the f acility’s 
manage ment of change (MOC) process to review ANY  
modifi cation or change.  
•When making visual i nspections, note every change 
from  previous inspections and notify the inspect ion 
depart ment of those changes. Protect  yourself  against 
sudden failure during the inspec tion. Sometimes visual 
inspection while the equipment is in service is not 
enough.  The equip ment may have t o be disassemble d 
or sim ply replaced at a defined interval.
•Know and plan around comm on ca uses of failures:
1) Ex pansion joints are usually weak s pots in piping systems.  
2) Misali gnment m ay cause stress cra cking.  
3) HCl embrittles stain less steel.  
Inspection and mainte nanc e progra ms should not 
overlook common causes and expe cted failure modes 
for expansion joints .

PSID m embers see Fre e Sear ch—hose
Chlorine was being transferred from a  railroa d tank 
car when the transfer hose burst.  Both automa tic and 
manual emergency shutdown system s failed so the 
release was unabated for about three hours.  
Approxi mately 48,000 pounds (21,800 kg) of chlorine 
escaped be fore e mergency responders were able to 
stop the rel ease.  They entered the chlorine cloud 
wearing “Cl ass A” safet y gear and climbed on top of 
the c ar to cl ose the manual shut off valves.  
Near by neighbors either evacuat ed or “sheltere d-in-
place.”  The adjacent Interstate was closed to traffic 
for 1 ½ hours.  Of the 63 people that sought medical 
evaluat ions due to respiratory distress, 3 were 
hospitaliz ed.  The release also da maged tre es and 
other veget ation in the ar ea.
The ruptured hose should have had an 
inner Tef lon liner reinforced wit h a 
Hastelloy C-276 exterior meta l brai ding.  
Instead, the exterior  met al support 
braiding was stainless steel and was 
easily corroded by chl orine permeation 
through the Teflon liner .  The hose failed 
after l ess than 2 m onths of service.   
Both t he purchase and shipping

constructed of the prope r mat erials, but it 
was not tested or verifie d upon rece ipt.

What YOU Can Do
Know what to do in an em ergency ! Always check to 
ensure  that emergency s hutdown eq uipment has  a 
curren t test tag.  If it does  not, repo rt it.  Test the entire 
shut down loop before yo u rely on it.  Your job—m ake 
sure it will work when needed!
Conduc t a pre- use check before us ing any  
replaceable  equipm ent, such as  hoses, s ample 
conta iners, instrum ents, e tc. to be s ure that they are fit 
for the service.  If in doubt—do not use it!
When rec eiving new equipm ent make                      
sure that  it is  exact ly what  was ordered.                      
Some materials are difficult to tell from                  
others,  but perform ance may  be                    
significantly diffe rent!
Ask for “pos itive materials ide ntification” tes ting 
where dif ferent materials look a like.  This is especia lly 
important where a m ix-up can lead to a hazardous event .  
Make this pa rt of the area ’s process hazards ana lysis.

Available When Needed???
A visible Hidden Ha zard !  
We don’t  know where this 
picture is from , but we thought  
it could be used to convey an 
important message. Someti mes 
hazards are right in front of us 
and we fai l to see them for 
what they are… because they 
are so obvious! In this case, it 
would be i mpossible to:
1) Get to the  valve quickly, and 
2) Operate the valve in an 
emergency.
As you go a bout your d aily duti es, think about this pictu re and look fo r similar “visible” 
hidden ha zards in you r facility.
•A chain AND two branches prevent this valve from being operated.  The valve and handl e 
are painted red which lead us to believe it’s part of a fir e wat er syste m—usuall y a pretty 
important  syste m in an e mergency.  This valve won’t be e asy to ac cess in an emergency and its 
pretty obvious it hasn’t been turned  in YEARS!  This faci lity m ust not have a progra m to test 
emergency syste ms regul arly.  What would you do if your job was to open or close this valve?
•This is an excell ent exampl e of an emergency syste m that  is NOT operabl e.  Your fa cility 
may have valves or other equipme nt that are even more inaccessible.  You don’t notic e the m 
because they are used inf requently and te nd to be forgotten---until they are needed. Whe re do 
they exist in your facility?
•Being able to access and operate  critical pieces of equipm ent is essent ial in today’s proces s 
and manufa cturing oper ations in all  industries.  It doesn’t ma tter if it is a valve, ele ctrical 
pushbutton, or just having a cle ar line of sight to a field temperatur e or pressure gage.  If you 
can’t get to it and use it as intended when needed , it is a hazard—someti mes a visible Hidden 
Hazard.  Do you have any of these vi sible Hidden Haza rds in your wo rkplace?
•The next  time you come  across a situation wher e access is difficult, or you have  conc erns

Thoroughly Evaluate Changes—Know , Don’t Guess the Consequences!This s mall stripper was used to separat e a light 
solvent from a heavier oil.  Annually, the unit 
was shut down for interna l inspect ion and 
cleaning.  The practice had been to allow 24 
hours for cooling down befor e starting 
maintenanc e work and opening the stripper.
This ti me, the shutdown tea m decided to  shorten 
the cool down period t o 12 hours to reduc e the 
time the uni t would be out of servic e.  
The unit wa s shut down, allowed to cool for 12 
hours and then the stripper was opened.  Almost 
immediat ely, smoke be gan to come out of the 
open ma nway.  There we re no visible  flames and 
no one was injured, but it was obvious that 
something had c aught on fire.
A Long Standing Procedure was C hanged 
without Understanding AL L Consequences!
•It  was believed  that  t he 24 hour  cool down 
period was to  protect            workers  from  hot   
surfaces.  No one                 understood that those        
same hot surfa ces                 might c ause residual      
solvent or oil to                   cat ch on fire.
•Oxygen was introduce d in to the vessel before 
the te mper ature had dropped below the 
autoigni tion point of som e of the r esidual 
materials.  This completed the fire triangle by  
adding oxygen to the  fue l and heat  already 
present.Unapproved Proced ure Change = Fire
•Understand the  reason for ea ch processing 
and ma intenanc e prepara tion step.                
Don’t assu me—KNO W!                  
•Know how  and when to use your facility’s 
managem ent of  change (M OC) process.  A sk to 
be sure that all changes have been r eviewed and 
approved before taking action .
•The proc ess safety infor mation should

What Happened?
What You Can Do
Union Carbide Bhopal PlantBhopal—A Tragi c Event
It was just after midni ght, 
December 3, 1984 in  
Bhopal, Indi a.  A 
successio n of eve nts 
occurred in the Union 
Carbide India Li mited 
facility th at led to the  
release of ~40 metric tons 
of me thyl isocyanat e (MIC)
The basic cause has been agreed 
upon by most e xperts who 
investigated this ev ent: a signific ant 
quantity of water entered the  MIC  
storage tank.  Wa ter reac ted with 
MIC, temperature and pres sure ro se 
and several  safety system s could not 
deal with the event.   Eventually, the 
vessel' s r elief device lifted, 
releasing MIC vapor. ……
20 years later, the exact water 
source rema ins controversial.  
However, it is clear that installed 
safety system s did NOT prevent a 
large re lease of toxi c gas. - More than an y other in the history of the chem ical industry, 
this incident dem onstra tes why robus t safety systems are critica l 
when handling hazardous materials.  This incident wa s also one of 
the driving forces which define d proc ess safety m anagem ent as 
we know it  today.
-Understa nd the react ivity hazards  of all materials in your 
process.  Read the reactivity sec tion of your MSDS 's, full y 
unders tand all reactivity instructions in you r opera ting proced ures 
and be knowledgeable abou t why your safe ty systems (e.g.  
interlocks, re lief devices, s crubbe rs) are there and how they  work.
- If a m aterial in your area react s with water: 1) be cautious
when washing equipm ent for m aintenance or whenever a water 
hose is used, and 2) remember that com pressed air may conta in 
condensed water  –be sure process a ir is free of water befor e 
blowing l ines.
- Unders tand the emergency procedures you are to take if the 
temperature or pressure increases quickly in vess els s toring 
hazardous m aterials, especi ally those which a re react ive.
- Encou rage your managem ent and  techn ical gro up to have a 
discussion about the “wo rst case” fo r the facility  you work in and 
what safeguards have to be m aintained to preven t tha t scenario 
from  occurr ing.gas.  The consequences     
were tragic:  acc ording to the 
Indian governm ent, m ore tha n 
3800 peopl e died shortl y after the 
release and thousands were  
injured. ……………… ......……….

PSID Members see:  Free Sear ch—D istillation colu mnFive weeks befor e the e xplosion, this tower was taken out of 
service.  Approxi mately 1,200 gallons (4,500 liters) of the 
hydrocarbons being processed rema ined in the tower .  
During those five we eks, stea m was sporadica lly and 
inadvert ently added to the tower.  The steam slowly heated 
the residua l material, but since the  tower was not opera ting, 
the temperat ure rise was unnotic ed by operations.  
On the morning of the a ccident, oper ations heard a rumbling 
coming from the tower and th en a loud sound si milar to a  
relief valve venting.  They sought shelt er in a nearby control  
room .  Within minut es the 145 foot (44 me ter) tall tower 
exploded inj uring three workers.
The explosion blew the top 35 feet (11 met ers) of the tower 
off and hurl ed debris a mi le (1.6 kil ometers).  Vessels as far 
as 500 feet (150 met ers) away wer e damaged and severa l 
fires started.  A portion of th e top sect ion of the tower was 
never found.
When oper ations decided to shut the steam of f, 
they closed the stea m supply valves, but those 
valves were corroded and a small amount of stea m 
leaked through.  Over the next 5 we eks, the 1,200 
gallons of hydrocarbons that  remained in the tower 
began to decompose  into unstable che micals 
because of t he inadvert ent long ter m heat ing.  
A PHA of a si milar but batch production process 
was conducted several years earli er and revea led 
that the chemi cals used  would decom pose above 
370 0F (188 0C).  This infor mation was never 
shared with those operat ing the cont inuous process.  
Therefor e, no temperature int erlocks were install ed 
and there was no me ntion of hi gh temper ature

ACT  before  the  REACTION   is  Uncon trolla ble !•Know the “shut down” and “ make-safe ” 
procedures for your unit.  Practic e them in 
your m ind.
•Many ac cidents happen each year 
because of valves that leak through.  
Whenever a process is shutdown, veri fy that 
manual valves are providing tight  shutoff.  
Take correct ive act ions if they are not.
•Recogniz e that all bui ldings are not safe 
havens.  In some cases the buildi ng may 
collapse if an explosion is nearby.  Know 
which buildi ngs are safe and which a re not.
•Pay at tention and r eact to unusual sound s 
and pressure/t emperatur e readings, even if 
the uni t is down.  They ma y be indicating a

A tank in this 55 year old fac ility that produces 
caramel coloring exploded, killing one worker and 
heavi ly damaging other equipme nt.  Vessel 
fragme nts were thrown as far as 150 yards/130 
meters and the top head of the vessel was propell ed 
100 yards/90 meters.  Shell fr agments da maged 
adjacent structures and equipme nt including an 
aqua a mmonia tank.  This resulted in the  release of 
26,000 pounds/12,000 kgm s of a qua a mmonia, 
causing near by residents to be evacuated or told to 
shelter in place.
Other major  damage included coll apsed concre te 
block walls, destruction of the spra y dryer area  as 
shown in the photograph, and the rupture of a  6 
inch natur al gas line.  F ortunate ly, automat ic shut-
off valves in the gas line prevented a major gas 
release.
The content s of the feed tank were overhea ted by 
steam coils, causing the vapor pre ssure to rise. 
There were no temperat ure al arms or interlocks to 
automatically st op the stea m flow or notify 
operations that ther e wa s a proble m. Because the 
operators were distrac ted by having to re-label a 
previously packaged order, they did not notice 
that the temperature in the t ank ha d risen above 
specif ications. At the same  time the t emperature 
was rising, the operator s closed a vent line and 
opened an air pressuriza tion line to t he tank in a n 
effort to “bl ow out” high viscous materi al.  That 
act complet ely blocked in the vessel which had no 
emergency relief  system .  The result—
catastrophic fa ilure to r elieve the pr essure.
All  Pres sured  Up  and  No  Place  to  go  =  BOOM !Pressure Explosio n Results
•Never comple tely block in a vesse l.  Some 
form  of em ergency  or m anual pressure relief (or 
vacuum  break) s ystem must be available.
•Vessels that a re heated should be monitore d 
close ly—especially if there are no safe ty 
instrumented systems or inte rlocks to shut off 
the heat s ource if needed. 
•Before connecting an a ir or nitrogen line to a 
vessel, m ake sure that the vessel can withs tand 
the full supply pressure or  that the vess el has  a 
suitable relief system set low enough to protect 
the vessel. 
•When doing jobs that distract you from your 
regular opera tions job, pe riodically check th e 
equipment to confirm t hat it is still operatin g 
norm ally. 
•Do not underes timate the power o f ove r-
pressurizatio n and its ab ility to cau se 
catastrophic failure.  Meta l fragm ents can travel  
long dis tances and do s ignificant dam age!
The explosi on was a simple case 
of over-pressurization."

Combustible Liquids + Heat = Fire… and Eventual Job Loss
A major fire destroyed this  motor oil and automotive 
fluids blending, storage and pa ckaging faci lity one  
evening after all r egular e mployees had l eft.  Be cause 
the facility was not designed to contain runoff and  
had no on-site f ire fighting capabilities, such as a 
sprinkler system or fire hydrants, the civi c authorities 
had no option but to let it burn.  The nearest source of 
fire fighting water was more than a mile away. 
The f acility was totally destroyed.  One business 
nearby was also destroye d and ma ny home s were 
damaged. Approxima tely 900,000 ga llons/3.4 
megaliters of liquid waste and 2,500 cubi c 
yards/1,900 cubic meters of cont aminated soil and 
debris had to be remove d for disposal.  There were no 
injuries, but the company decided not to rebuil d and 
100 community  jobs were lost.
Evidenc e of how the  fire start ed was 
destroyed, but it is believed that  a 
combustible  liquid, perhaps on a rag, 
conta cted a hot motor or light.  After it 
started to burn, there  were no protect ive 
syste ms in plac e to stop or control it and the 
fire water supply was too far away for civi c 
responders to use quickl y.
Dikes surrounded the tank far m, but the 
walls were not liquid tight.  As vessels failed, 
flaming liquid quickly spread involving other 
vessels. B ecause there was inadequat e 
separation betwe en the t ank far m and 
warehouses, flames moved qui ckly from  area 
to area.
The fa cility did not  have  any on-site fire 
detection syste ms and di d not conform to any 
voluntary fire code standard.  •Be aware that combustible liquids are fir e 
hazardsjust as fla mmables are.  They may be  
harder to ignite, but once started they burn with 
spectacul ar results.
•Take c are when handli ng com busti ble liquids.  
Be sure to use containers specifi cally designed to 
store or dispose of combustibl es and their waste 
products, such as oily r ags which ca n easily igni te 
due to a wicking effec t.  Don’t just throw the m 
away like tr ash or leave them in the work area. 
•Inspect your work area  for fire haz ards and 
protect ion syste ms.  Make sure that fire 
suppression and control procedure s are in-pla ce 
and ava ilable.  Pay particular a ttenti on to passive 
protect ion syste ms and l ook for crac ks or holes in 
dikes and walls around storage t anks.  
•Know what to do in a  fire emergency.  Know  
how to report the fi re, how to use a fir e 
extinguisher , how to shut down equipment 
quickly, and your escape  route.Storage Ar ea Completely Destroyed

The evening shift was assigned to clean an 
agitated mixing vessel.  The supervisor asked the  
lead operator to compl ete the “Lock out.”  The 
lead operat or tagged a nd locked out the m otor 
starter in the Motor Co ntrol Center, verif ied the 
motor would not start by pressing the Start  
button and put a  lock and “Dange r—Do Not 
Operate ” tag on the St art-Stop station near the 
vessel. The superviso r then issued the Conf ined 
Space Entry per mit and two workers  entered the 
vessel and c leaned i t for the rest of the shift.
The oncomi ng day shift needed to reissue the 
Conf ined Space Entry permit.  When they tried 
the Start button on the Start-Stop station, the  
agitator star ted!  The agitator motor was NOT
locked out! 
Easier than you might imagine. Did the Lock-out undo 
itself?   No, but the wrong m otor was locked out.  How  
can that happen when the star ter was labeled the same as 
the agit ator?   And, why didn’t the agitator start when the 
Start button was tested the first time?
Here’s how.  Several months before , the agitator motor 
was changed out to a larger size.  The size increase 
required a l arger motor  starter and wiring. Because the 
plant might  need the “old” syste m again some day, i t 
was not re moved .   Instead, a new Start-Stop station was 
installed near the vesse l, in fact, ri ght next to the old

How  Did This Happen ? What You Can Do
Sevente en years ago ( July 6, 1988), le aking 
natural  gas condensat e on the Pipe r Alpha oil 
platform in the North Sea exploded.  The  
explosion di sabled the communic ations center 
and was fol lowed by a fireball and a large oil 
pool fire.  The fire  ruptured a ma jor gas line 
that was transporting gas from a nother oil 
platform to Piper Alpha. That  massive gas 
release c aused a l arger explosion and fire which 
engul fed the entire pl atform.  Within an hour, 
other gas lines ruptured and the  fire was 
compl etely out of control.
165 workers and 2 rescuers were killed.  The 
platform was totally dest royed.Piper Alpha Oil Platform Destroyed
The Piper Al pha p latform drilled for oil and proces sed 
natural gas from othe r platform s.  A main tenance crew 
was working on a  pum p in the gas processing unit.  As 
part of their work, they removed a re lief valve from the 
pump’s discharge line—b ut did NOT install a regula r 
blind flange to cover the opening.  The y did not com plete 
the repai r work that shift so they told the shi ft supe rvisor  
that the p ump shou ld not be used.  Unfo rtunately, this 
message was not given to the opera tors on the next shift.
When the prim ary pum p failed , the operators  started the  
pump that had been taken out of service.  Gas condensate 
immediate ly escaped from  the opening where the relief 
valve sh ould have been.  An explo sion and fi re occurre d 
damaging fire wall s and the cont rol room.  The heat from 
this fire ru ptured gas t ransportation pipelines from other 
platforms—which  added to the fire and e nsuing dam age.  
The fire water pum ps ha d been placed in the “m anual”  
position since dive rs were in the sea earlier during the  
day and n o one activated the system during the 
emergency .  Em ergency evacuation routes from  the  
crew’s living quarters were bl ocked b y smoke and f ires. •Communi cate effective ly at shift turnover.

Hazard Investigation Board.  Visit their site at ht tp://www.csb.gov
Fifte en truc ks of sodium hydrosulfide 
(NaSH) had be en de livered to the facility  
in the pr evious 24 hours.  Each truck is 
believed to have spilled about 5 ga llons 
(19 liters)  in to the collection pit.  
Construction e mploye es were working in 
the area and needed to ent er the 
collection pit. Operations drained the pit  
into what was believed to be the 
wastewater  system .  Instead, t he pit 
drained in t o a sewer line where sulfuric 
acid was present in quantit ies suffici ent 
to react with the NaSH.   
As soon as the two che micals mixed, 
they rea cted and toxic hydrogen sulfide 
gas was  released.  The t oxic gas escaped 
from the se wer syste m through the seal  of 
a fibergl ass manhol e cover near  the 
workers .Several construction employees 
working near a collection pit were 
overcome with hydrogen sulfide  
gas.  The gas was relea sed nearby 
when sodium  hydrosulfide was 
accidentally mixed with sulf uric 
acid.  Thr ee workers coll apsed 
almost i mmediately and thre e 
others tried to rescue t hem.  Two 
of those resc uers also collapsed.  In 
all, ten workers were e xposed to

Although the fa cility ha ndles both 
propane and natura l gas, evidenc e 
suggests that an undete cted 
natural gas leak slowly supplied  
gas to a confined space. It reached 
an explosive level and found an 
ignition source.
There were  several wa rning, or 
near- misses, be fore the e xplosion.  
Twice the preceding week, gas 
odors had been det ected. In the 
first incident, the leak s ource was 
never found and the odor was 
blamed on wind blowing the gas 
“smell” into the building f rom 
outside. The second near- miss 
resulted in a plant evacuation and 
occurred be cause a tank outside 
of the building leaked gas into a 
pipe that opened in the building.  
Both inc idents contributed to a  
desensitization of the hazards of  
natural gas.   
Don’t Ignore Even Sm all Fuel Leaks.   TestTest Suspicious Atmospheres.Did You Know?Did You Know?
•Not all natural gas or Propane is odorized.  Usual ly a mercaptan is 
added as the odo rant.
•The lower exp losive limit for natural gas is only 4.3% by volume 
in air.  It takes very little to get in to the explosive rang e.
•Not all flammable vapo rs behave the same.  Usuall y, natural gas 
and hydrogen are lighter than air and m ay accum ulate in high 
spaces.  Propane is heavie r than air and flows along the ground like a 
river of vapo r that pools in low spots.
What You Can DoWhat You Can Do
•ALL gas leaks are dangerous!  Even  very small leaks  can supply 
enough  fuel to cause a des tructive exp losion. Repor t, find an d 
correc t every gas leak.
•If you smell gas, SAFELY evacuate the area.  Do not turn on 
lights or equipm ent that might supply  an ignitio n source.  Stop  all 
hot work IMMEDI ATELY!
•To stop a leak, be aware t hat closing valves or shutting down 
equipm ent m ay provide an ignition source.  Kno w where rem ote 
shut off va lves and switche s are and use them .
•When y ou test for explos ive atmospheres be sure to use the right 
type of test equipm ent that is ca librated according to m anufacturer’s 
recom mendations and spec ifications.
•Once the lea k is controlle d, ventilate c onfined spac es carefully!
When you ventilate a fue l rich a tmosphere, it will pass  through the 
explosive range and an y ignition source will cause an explos ion.others were caused by a coll apsing building.  Evacu ation from buildings

Your Response to an Emer gency Should Be No Accident!Did You Know?Did You Know? What You Can DoWhat You Can Do
In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the 
United States Gulf Coast causing over 1000 fatalities 
and billions of dollars in damage. Critical oil and 
chemical facilities were impacted by this storm. This 
storm, the 2004 Tsunami, a nd other natural events –
floods, earthquakes, blizzards, tornadoes – demonstrate that none of us are immune to catastrophic impacts of a 
natural disaster. They remind us of the importance of 
emergency planning at all levels – from a plant incident 
to a natural disaster imp acting millions of people. 
Preparation and planning are essential to minimize 
damage, rescue victims, and recover from the disaster.
¾Every facility – plant, depot, warehouse, 
laboratory , office – should have a plan for 
emergency response for all types of natural and 
human caused incidents. Does yours include 
weather related incidents?
¾Everybody has a role! Some are direct 
responders, such as members of the fire brigade, 
others are responsible for shutting down operations, still others are required to leave their 
work area to get out of danger.  But, everyone 
has something they MUST do!
¾Practice is essential to good emergency 
response. That is why we have fire drills and 
other tests. Follow up the drills with a critique –
what went well and what could have been done better?¾Learn your facility AND community 
emergency response plans and understand 
what you have to do.
¾Participate in drills and take them seriously.
¾Develop a personal emergency response 
plan for your family. Th ink about what kind of 
disasters could occur where you live –
hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, floods. Make sure everybody in your family 
knows where to go and how to get there. 
Think about how to get back in touch if you 
are separated.
¾Excellent emergency response is a result of 
excellent preparation.  So be READY!

PSID Members see Free Search: StartupA number of chemical facilities have had disastrous events occurduring startup activities.  In many cases, these events point to the 
need for a higher level of attenti on and care than th at needed for 
routine processing. WHY?  Startup hazards are increased by 
inexact operating instructions, lack of experience in startup 
operations, and a plant in a non-standard condition – for example,
feed tanks empty, manual valves in the wr ong position, new or modified equipment. Time 
pressures to get the plant back in operation may be high, and operators may have worked long 
hours during the shutdown, making them less alert.  Many plants require manual operation during 
startup. Continuous plants may startup so infrequen tly that plant  personnel have little experience 
with required steps."

Learn from experience – report and share incidents and near misses!Did You Know?Did You Know? What You Can DoWhat You Can DoMany chemicals have a ‘shelf life’ ,they become unstable or reactive 
with time in storage. For example,  some monomers require inhibitor 
to prevent polymerization, and, after a period of time, the inhibitor is 
consumed. The manufacturer of  such chemicals will normally 
provide an “expiration date” for the material, and it is important to 
use the material or properly dispose of it before that expiration date.  
A company had two “near misses” – bulging or ruptured drums –
because time sensitive chemicals had been stored too long.
PSID Members see Free Search: Reactive Chemicals
Fortunately nobody was hurt, and damage was minor. The 
company had a good system for reporting and sharing near 
misses, and these incidents were shared throughout the 
organization. Another plant saw the reports, and immediately 
checked all of the material in  the warehouse. They found four 
drums of the same material wh ich were past the expiration 
date and had begun to polymerize.   Luckily, none of the drums 
had ruptured. The plant safely discarded the material and a 
potential explosion or injury was avoided.
• Some reactive chemicals must be used by a 
specified date or they will become unstable.
• Other chemicals can accumulate impurities 
(such as peroxides) over time and can also become unstable.
• Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) 
should tell you if materials can become unstable with time or need special storage 
conditions.
• Reporting and investigating “near misses”
is an excellent way to prevent future 
incidents.
• That the December 2005 Beacon was the 
50
thissue, sharing lessons from safety 
incidents with thousands of people in 11 languages.• Know if chemicals in your workplace can become 
unstable during storage – check the MSDS, with 
your safety specialist, or contact the supplier.
• Understand and follow your  company’s procedure 
for managing time sensitive materials (make sure 
you have one!); they should not be stored too long.
• Report all incidents and near misses to help 
prevent future incidents.
• Share incidents with us at the CCPS Beacon so we 
can all learn from your experiences, and READ

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - March 2006 [2006-03-Beacon-English_0]","ANY open pipe is a potential chemical discharge!¾Relief valves and rupture disks are part of an 
emergency pressure relief system .  Its design must not 
only prevent equipment overpressure, it must also make certain that material discharged does not lead to 
personnel injury. The system  needs to ensure that 
there is no fire, explosion, or toxic material exposure hazard from the material released through a relief 
valve or rupture disk.
¾Plant modifications include new platforms, vessels, 
piping and a variety of othe r additions.  Potential 
exposure to effluent from existing AND new pressure relief devices must be included in your management of change process.
¾Drain, vent and sample valves from equipment or 
piping as well as vessel overflows can have similar hazards. Any material which could be released from process equipment, including pressure relief valves or 
rupture disks, must disch arge to a safe location.
¾ANY open pipe has the potential for an unexpected 
discharge.  The release could occur for a variety of reasons and it will often be a surprise.  Use extra caution when working around them - expect the unexpected!The discharge from the relief valve in picture 
#1 is directed toward a personnel access platform above. If the relief valve opens while someone is working on the platform, that person would be 
exposed to the discharged material and possibly 
injured.
The relief valve discharge in picture #2 is 
through a long, unsupported pipe.  The force 
generated by the material flow could bend, break or restrict the discharge pipe, any of which could lead to personnel exposure or a failure of the system to operate as intended.
The discharge from the relief valves in picture 
#3 is directed downward, toward an area where people could be working. As in the first picture, 
anyone working in this area when a relief valve 
opens could be injured. Th e discharge pipes are also 
long and unsupported as in picture #2.
These pictures illustrate hazards found in many 
plants which handle chemi cals.  Relief devices often 
discharge to a ‘convenient’ location - and that may not be the same as a ‘safe’ location!PProcess rocess SSafety afety BBeaconeacon

Dust Explosion Hazards
The picture on the left shows a monument to the anthracite coal miners of 
northeastern Pennsylvania, located in the town of Jim Thorpe (named after the 
famous Olympic athlete). It is a single rock of anthracite coal – over 7 tons of 
nearly pure carbon. The sign on the monument indicates that it has an energy 
content of 205 million BTU (216,000 million joules), equivalent to about 50 tons 
of TNT! So, should we be worried about this huge amount of energy located in the middle of a small town? Of course not, b ecause it would be extremely difficult to 
ignite this large rock of coal, and, if ignited, it would burn very slowly.
But, what would happen if we ground up a few kilograms of that coal into a fine 
powder, as in the picture at the right, and su spended that powder in the air as a dust 
cloud in a building or other confined space? If we lit a match or provided some other ignition source such as an el ectric spark, the result might be a massive and damaging 
dust explosion. The picture below shows the results of such an explosion, which killed 6 people and injured 37.
Did you know?
¾Most solid materials which will burn can form an explosive dust
cloud if the particle size of the soli d is small enough. Some examples of 
materials which can explode as a dust include wood, flour, sugar, grain, plastics, many solid organic chemicals, and many metals.
¾Accumulations of dust on floors, tops of vessels or  tanks, support 
beams, in cable trays, above suspe nded ceilings, can form an explosive 
cloud if somehow disturbed and lifted into the air.¾A dust layer 1/32 inch (less than 1 mm) thick on exposed surfaces 
can create an explosive dust cloud once suspended in air.¾A dust layer can be considered to create a hazardous condition if it 
covers an area, on all surfaces, greater than 5 % of the floor area of a 
room.
What can you do?
¾Be aware of the potential for a dust explosion when you handle solid materials which can burn. Follow the 
specified safe operating procedures for handling powders and dusts in your plant.¾Do not allow dust to accumulate on floors, on top of equipment, on beams, or other places. Be aware of 
those “hard to see” areas such  the top of tanks or ab ove a suspended ceiling a nd check them for dust 
accumulation regularly. Watch all areas,  even those corners and hidden spaces.
¾Be particularly careful to prevent dust accumulation on hot surfaces such as light fixtures, electric motors, 
steam pipes, etc., where the heat  may cause the dust to ignite.
¾Be sure that any equipment used to  clean up dust (for example, an el ectric vacuum cleaner) is appropriate 
for use in an atmosphere which could contain an explosive dust.

Is this valve open?…… . or closed? 
Many people would expect this valve to be closed 
-the position of the valve handle (in this case, a 
“valve wrench”) is perpendicular to the pipe. But 
close inspection of the valve position indicator 
shows it is parallel to the pipe, clearly indicatin g 
the valve is open!  WHY?  The valve wrench 
collar is square and can be positioned in two ways 
– one with the valve wrench parallel to the valve 
position indicator and the other with the valve 
wrench perpendicular to the position indicator.
This confusing setup was one cause of an incident

follow your plant’s procedures for keeping incompat ible 
materials apart in storage and use. Many plants use  a chemical 
compatibility chart to summarize this information. 
/head2rightInspect all chemical containers regularly and ensur e that they 
are properly labeled. Replace any containers which are 
damaged or leaking. 
/head2rightClean up all spills of materials immediately. Don’t  let spilled 
material accumulate, waiting to contact other mater ials in the

/head2rightFill and empty chemical containers in approved loca tions 
where this can be done safely. 
/head2rightDo not store chemical containers near fire exits, s afety 
showers or eye wash stations, near electrical boxes  and cable 
trays, or other important equipment. What can you do? 
/head2rightMany chemicals are incompatible with 
each other, and can cause fires or toxic 
fumes when they react. 
/head2rightWhen incompatible materials react, 
they may get hot enough to ignite and 
start a fire. 
/head2rightSpilled incompatible materials may not 
react immediately – the reaction might 
start slowly and only get hot enough to 
burst into flame after some time. 
/head2rightGood housekeeping is not just about 
appearance – spilled chemicals can cause 
fire and health hazards. Small charges for several batch processes were tran sferred into small 
containers and placed on a pallet near the reactors  so they would be easily 
available when needed. The picture on the right sho ws a re-creation of the 
raw material pallet. 
There was a fire in the manufacturing building whic h started on or near 
the pallet. The fire was extinguished by the buildi ng sprinkler system and 
there were no injuries. However, the fire caused ex tensive damage to 
electrical power, control and instrumentation wirin g, and the plant was 
shut down for a long time while the damage was repa ired. The picture on 
the left below shows the actual pallet after the fi re, and the picture on the 
right shows some of the damaged cable and wiring. 
The investigation revealed that the some of the 
materials in the containers were incompatible and, 
over time, chemicals had leaked from damaged 
containers, overfilled containers, or from spills o n 
the outside of containers. Some of this material fe ll 
through the open grate floor into a cable tray belo w 
the floor. It was difficult to see the spilled mate rial 
in the cable tray, or to clean it up, and eventuall y

Static Electricity 
What can you do? 
/head2rightStatic electric charges on material, equipment, and  
people result from materials contacting each other and 
then being separated. Electric charge can transfer from 
one of the materials to the other, and this charge will 
build up if it cannot flow to ground. 
/head2rightSolids or liquid drops falling through air can crea te 
static charges on the solids or drops. 
/head2rightStatic electric discharges can be sufficiently ener getic 
to ignite a flammable atmosphere –for example the 
vapors from a flammable liquid or a combustible dus t 
cloud. 
/head2rightThe first defense against static ignition is to eli minate 
the flammable atmosphere if possible. If this is no t 
possible, it is important to prevent and control 
electrostatic charge accumulation. 
/head2rightBonding means that conductive parts of equipment ar e 
connected to each other so there can be no electric  
discharges between the parts. 
/head2rightGrounding means that conductive parts of equipment 
are connected to an electrical ground, preventing e lectric 
discharges to ground. A customer was filling an ungrounded gasoline 
can in the cargo area of a truck when the 
vapors were ignited by a static electric 
discharge. The fire caused severe damage to 
the truck and the gasoline station. The 
customer suffered severe burns on both legs, 
and it could have been much worse if four 
bystanders had not managed to extinguish the 
flames using their own clothing.

/head2rightAlways ground conductive containers - drums, pails, 
portable tanks, tank trucks, railroad cars, and any  other 
vessels - when transferring flammable or combustible  
materials.
/head2rightMake sure that process equipment is properlygrounde d, 
and that grounding is periodically tested.
/head2rightMinimize free fall of solids or liquids through the  air 
when filling vessels and containers.
/head2rightIf you do maintenance on equipment, make sure that 
all grounding connections are properly replaced and  
tested following the maintenance.

pumped into a storage tank at the Buncefield Oil St orage 
Depot in Hertfordshire, England. At about 1:30 AM a  stock 
check of the tanks showed nothing abnormal. From ab out 3 
AM, the level gauge in one of the tanks recorded no  change 
in reading, even though flow was continuing at a ra te of about 
550 cu. meters/hour (2400 US gallons/minute). Calcu lations 
show that the tank would have been full at about 5: 20 AM, 
and that it would then overflow. Pumping continued and the 
excess gasoline overflowed from the top of the tank  and 
cascaded down the sides, forming a liquid pool and a cloud of 
flammable gasoline vapor. At about 6:00 AM the clou d 
ignited and the first explosion occurred, followed by 
additional explosions and a fire which engulfed 20 storage

/head2rightThe tank involved in this incident had an 
independent high level alarm and interlock, but it did 
not work – the cause of the failure is still under

/head2rightA spill of flammable material such as gasoline can 
form a dense flammable vapor cloud which can grow 
and spread at ground level until it finds an igniti on 
source, which can cause the cloud to explode. /head2rightWhen you transfer material, make sure that you 
know where it is going. 
/head2rightWhen you are pumping into a tank, if the level or 
weight indicator in that tank does not increase as you 
would expect, stop the transfer and find out what i s 
happening. 
/head2rightMake sure that all safety alarms and interlocks are  
tested at the frequency recommended by the plant 
process safety management procedures. 
/head2rightIf you have alarms and interlocks which are not

Community 
Damage June 24, 2005was a hot, sunny summer day in St. Lou is, 
with temperatures reaching 97F (36C). Operations at  a 
gas cylinder packaging and distribution facility pr oceeded 
normally during the morning and early afternoon. 
However, about 3:20 pm, a technician retrieving 
cylinders from an outside storage area saw a ten-fo ot high 
flame coming from a cylinder and activated the fire  
alarm. Propylene gas had been released from the rel ief 
device on a cylinder valve and ignited. Workers and  
customers evacuated. The fire spread to adjacent 
cylinders, which ignited and began exploding, flyin g into 
other areas of the facility, and spreading the fire . After 4 
minutes, the fire covered most of the facility’s fl ammable 
gas cylinder area and explosions were frequent. 
Dozens of cylinders and cylinder parts were propell ed into the community and were found on sidewalks, front 
yards, backyards, courtyards, parking lots, and und er cars. Damage included a burned empty commercial 
building, fire-damaged cars, a three-foot hole in t he wall of one residential building, broken windows , and 
other destruction to residential and commercial bui ldings. Cylinder parts were found as far as 800 fee t away. 
/head2rightSome materials stored in containers such as drums, 
cylinders, and pails can be heated to a hazardous 
temperature if they are stored outdoors and exposed  to 
direct sunlight. 
/head2rightThe hazard can be a result of decomposition, 
polymerization, or other chemical reaction, or it c an 
simply be over pressurization of the container beca use 
of the vapor pressure of the contents, as in the in cident 
described above. 
/head2rightIn this incident, direct sunlight, and an unusually  
hot day, probably raised the temperature of the 
cylinder and its contents to about 150F (65 C), 
sufficient to open the relief device and release th e gas. "

What can you do? Sponsored by Sponsored by

A vessel has a rupture disk and a pressure relief 
valve in series to protect against high pressure in  the 
vessel. There is a pressure gage on the pipe betwee n 
the rupture disk and the relief valve. As a part of  
your regular plant inspection, you are supposed to 
check the pressure gage. The gage normally reads 
zero. Today  you observe a pressure of nearly 50 
psig (~3.5 barg) as shown. 
Do you understand why this is a significant 
hazard? How does pressure between the rupture disk 
and the pressure relief valve affect the performanc e 
of the vessel overpressure protection system? 
/head2rightA rupture disk bursts when the pressure on the proc ess 
side of the disk exceeds the pressure on the downst ream 
side by the design pressure of the rupture disk. So , a 100 
psi (6.9 bar) rupture disk will burst when the pres sure on 
the process side of the disk is 100 psi (6.9 bar) g reater 
than the pressure downstream of the disk. 
/head2rightThe pressure might be caused by a small “pinhole”
leak in the rupture disk which will allow material to 
slowly leak through the disk and build up pressure,  or it 
could be the result of a burst rupture disk. 
/head2rightBecause there is nearly 50 psig (3.5 barg) pressure  on 
the downstream side of this rupture disk, if the pr essure 
was caused by a pinhole leak, the rupture disc will  not 
burst until the pressure in the vessel is equal to the 
rupture disk design pressure plus 50 psi (3.5 bar).  If this 
is a 100 psi disk, it will not burst until the vess el pressure 
is nearly 150 psig (~10.3 barg). This might result in 
failure of other equipment attached to the vessel -
perhaps a sight glass, a hose, or a gasket which ca nnot 
withstand the higher pressure. Rupture

Laboratory Damage Intact cylinder and remains of  
ruptured cylinder pressure relief valve and rupture

brass plugs at some time in the 
past by an unknown person. 
Before the incident, the cylinder 
may have been leaking through 
an old gasket, providing 
sufficient release of gas to 
prevent over pressure. 
Approximately twelve hours 
before the explosion, the leaking gasket had been r eplaced and the cylinder 
refilled with liquid nitrogen. With the new gasket,  the cylinderwas now 
completely sealed, and pressure could build up. The  cylinder ruptured when its 
internal pressure rose above 1000 psi (69 bar). The  catastrophic failure of the 
nitrogen cylinder was a result of the removal of th e pressure relief devices. "

With the liquid completely covering the displacer, the instrument did

In other words, the instrument was not designed to function properly if the level was high enough to completely submerge the displacer. The column was heated during the startup. As the temperature of the liquid increased (the green line in the graph above –

occurred over 80 years ago is not relevant to today’s industry. But, we still have catastrophic failures of storage tanks today (see pictures below), and for similar reasons.• A large quantity of any liquid, even a non-hazardous material such as molasses or water, 
can be dangerous if rapidly released in large quantities, simply because of its volume and mass.On January 15, 1919, pe ople in north Boston, Massachusetts heard a 
loud rumbling noise and watched in horror as a 50 foot (15 m) high 
tank containing 2.3 million US gallo ns (8700 cubic me ters) of molasses 
suddenly broke apart, releasing its contents into the city. A wave of 
molasses over 15 feet (5 m) high  and 160 feet (50 m) wide surged
through the streets. How slow is molasses in January? This wave 
traveled at an estimated speed of 35 miles per hour (60 km/hour) for more than 2 city blocks. 21 people were killed, over 150 injured, and 
the damage estimate was equivalent to over 100 million US dollars in 
today’s currency.
What caused this catastrophic ta nk failure? Some of the causes 
identified by the in vestigation included:
• The tank was not properly inspected during construction.
• The tank was not tested after cons truction and before filling it with 
molasses.
• The tank had been obse rved to be leaking at  the welds between the 
tank’s steel plates be fore the failure, but no action had been taken.
Remember the lessons of the past!• If you observe leakage, corrosion, or other indication of potential 
failure in a storage tank, report it immediately to management. • Make sure that any new tank, or one being returned to service following repair or inactivity, is pr operly inspected and tested before 
filling.• Ensure you know the operating cap acities of your tanks and double 
check the level before filling.• Don’t throw out your old incident reports. Read them again, and remember the lessons. We can learn a lot from things that happened a long time ago.May 2007

What do these incidents, which were all major failures of complex technical systems, 
have in common? In all of them, the incident investigations identified problems in the organization’s “safety culture” as an impor tant contributing factor. But, what is 
“safety culture”? The United Kingdom Health  and Safety Execu tive defines safety 
culture as “ ... the product of the individual and group values, attitudes, competencies and patterns of behavior that determine the commitment to, and the style and proficiency of, an organization's health and safety programs.” It sounds pretty 
complicated, and  CCPS suggests a simpler definition:  “Safety culture is how the 
organization behaves when no one is wa tching.” While management has a key 
leadership role in establishing a good safety culture in an organization, everybody 
must contribute. In this Beacon, we w ill focus on one important aspect of safety 
culture – maintaining a sense of vulnerability
– and cover others in future issues.
Since catastrophic accidents are not very common, it is easy to begin to believe that 
nothing bad can happen. People can become complacent, and have a false sense of 
security. Good operations can be compro mised. Critical protective systems and 
procedures may not be main tained, or may be changed without proper understanding 
of the possible consequences. Eliminating se rious incidents require s constant attention 
to the potentially catastrophic results of hazardous activities.February 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia breaks up

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - July 2007 [2007-07-Beacon-English_0]","On an offshore oil platform, operat ors were transferring methanol 
from a portable chemical transpor ter tank connected by a hose to a 
storage tank. When the tank was lift ed by a crane to gravity feed the 
storage tank, methanol began sprayi ng out from a hole in the hose. 
The methanol ignited on the top d eck. Methanol that was sprayed 
over the side also igni ted by the hot exhaust of  a compressor located 
immediately below the transfer po int on the second deck. The fire 
was compounded by the breaking of the transfer tank’s sight glass 
when a crewman attempted to kick the valve closed. The fire spread 
as relief valves on two other chemical transport tanks opened.
After twenty-two 30-pound hand-held chemical fire extinguishers,  
two 125-pound wheeled fire extingui sher units, and the firewater 
system were used, the fires on both decks were contained. One man 
received second-degree burns. After the fires were extinguished, it 
was discovered that the hose used  to feed methanol from the 
transporter to the storage tank was split and had been repaired with 
duct tape prior to the operation!
Check your equipment before you start the job!• NEVER make temporary or unauthorized repair s on equipment in hazardous material service 
without a management of chan ge review by qualified personnel.
• ALWAYS inspect equipment before using it.  If there is any sign of da mage, corrosion, improper 
repair, or any other defect, replace the equipment before you start the job.
• Avoid transferring flammable products near ignition sources such as compressors.July 2007

“black light” to in spect the open pipe. 
Unfortunately, approximately 150 feet away, and several floors below this work location, there was an open nitrogen line connected to the piping. The nitrogen flowed through the pi pe and out of the 
open pipe end shown. The black sheet used 
to cover the open pi pe end provided 
sufficient confinement to trap nitrogen

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - December 2007 [2007-12-Beacon-English_0]","An 80,000 barrel (3.6 million gallon, 12,700 cu. M.) floating roof storage tank 
exploded and burned while be ing filled with diesel oil at a petroleum product 
storage terminal. The tank containe d approximately 7000 barrels (300,000 
gallons, 1,100 cu. M) of diesel oil at the time of the incident, and had previously contained gasoline. The fire burned  for 21 hours and damaged two nearby 
storage tanks. There were no injuries or fatalities, but the total loss was over two 
million US dollars, nearby residents were evacuated, and schools in the area were closed for two days.
Initially, the fire was blamed on a lightning strike, but a thorough incident 
investigation by the United States Nati onal Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
found that the causes included an improper procedure for switching the content of the tank from gasoline to diesel oil,  and an unsafe filling procedure. NTSB 
concluded that the flow rate (velocity) of material flowing into the tank was too 
high while the tank level was low and th e incoming liquid discharged into the 
vapor space of the tank, The high flow rate  caused a static electric discharge in 
the tank vapor space, which contained a flammable atmosphere.
Remember that rapid flow of liquid into  air can cause static electric sparks!• When changing the contents of any vessel 
(tank, tank truck, rail road tank car), without 
thoroughly cleaning the tank and purging the vapors, you can possibly create an unexpected  flammable atmosphere in the tank. The flammable atmosphere might not be expected based on the properties of the new material being introduced to the tank.• High flow velocity of material discharging into the vapor space of a tank can cause static levels sufficient to ignite flammable vapor inside the tank.December 2007

failure. Some failures result in  near misses - that is they 
did not cause an incident this time, but could have. 
• Almost every month, “The Beacon” receives a number 
of emails pointing out other lessons that can be learned 
from the incident discussed, which have not been included in the Beacon.
• Because of the limited space available in “The Beacon”, 
we must pick one of the many lessons from each incident, and focus the Beacon on that lesson. But there are always other lessons.
• Whenever possible, if the reports on the incidents 
described are publicly ava ilable, we will provide a 
reference in the Beacon cover email note.
One important issue in maintaining a good process safety culture in any organization is to maintain a sense of vulnerability. In other wo rds, we must always remember, and respect, 
the hazards associated with our processes and materials.  If we have good and effective 
process safety management systems, one result is  that we will have fewer incidents. This 
can lead to complacency - we forget why we are doing all of the activities in the processsafety management system which result in good  performance and few or no incidents. So, it 
is important to use resources like ""The Beac on"" to remind ourselves of what can happen if 
we don't do those activities – such as Hazard Iden tification and Risk Analysis (including 
assigning our most knowledgeable people to Pr ocess Hazard Analysis studies), Operating 
Procedures, Asset Integrity and Reliabil ity, Management of Change, Emergency 
Management, Incident Investigation, Auditing, and others. In all of the incidents we discuss 
in the Beacon, there has been a failure in one  or more of these important process safety 
management systems
What can you do?
• Good – post the Beacon in places where workers will see it and read it – for example, bulletin boards, locker rooms, lunch rooms, control rooms, the gate house.
• Better – use the Beacon as the basis for safety meetings or 
other safety discussions with operators and other workers.
• Better yet – Develop additional information which relates 
the topic in the Beacon to the operations in your own plant, including any similar incidents or near misses in your company, and discuss this information with workers.
• Best – Unit or plant management leads a discussion of  
the Beacon with workers and challenges them to find other lessons in the incident described, beyond those discussed in the Beacon. Challenge plant safety committees to use the 
Beacon in their work."

While the system was designed with the correct 
safeguards, they were not functional as a system. 
The pump and shutoff valv e were too far from 
the receiving tank to stop flow before the tank overflowed – the liquid in  the pipe downstream 
of the valve was enough to overflow the tank 
even though the valve had closed. Alternatively, 
the high level switch could be installed lower in the tank to shut  the flow off s ooner and account 
for the materials between the shut off valve and the receiving tank. In ge neral, it is good practice 
to locate a device to pr event tank overflow as 
close to the tank being protected as possible. What happened?
A small chemical feed syst em was designed to refill 
automatically. It had a high shut off interlock that 
stopped the feed pump and closed a feed valve to 
prevent overflowing the tank. The level control system 
had a malfunction, the tank was filled above the design 
level, and the high level switch tripped. Before the 
control system could close the valves and stop the 
pump, the tank overflowed. Fortunately, no employees 
were injured and the spill  was contained to limit 
environmental damage.
• During a process hazard anal ysis, or any other safety 
review, ask if anyone has veri fied that automatic shutoff 
systems actually work effectively.
• When starting up a new or mo dified safety system, test 
operation of the entire system to  verify that it operates as 
intended.
• Review testing procedures for critical shut off systems, 
and make sure they actually test the complete system, not just single components of the system. 
• Do not accept small spills as the “cost of doing 
business”. Small spills indicate problems which may be prevalent in the facility and should not be regarded as normal. Where there is one inadequate design, 
maintenance practice, or opera ting procedure, others are 
often present.

following markings on the gr ound made by the pipeline 
company, which were differe nt from the engineering 
plans. The engineering drawings showed the pipe curving 
out around the trunk of a tr ee, which had been cut down 
after the pipeline was built. Workers and supervisors did not visually verify the pipe location using hand tools as 
required by good practice.

investigation indicates that this was a dust explosion. 
Many people are not aware of the e xplosion hazard of many dusts and

Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Marathi, Persia n, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Thai, Tur kish, and Vietnamese.
The conditions needed for a dust e xplosion can be represented as a pe ntagon (see figure at left above):
•FUEL – The presence of a combustible dust. Pa rticle size is important – smaller particles are more likely to be both 
ignitable and dispersible.•OXIDANT – usually oxygen in the air, which is generally enough to support an explosion.
•SUSPENSION – The dust needs to be dispersed into the air. The dust may normally be dispersed in air in the process 
equipment. In a building, this could be done by a large leak or  spill, a small initial dust explosion, or any other disturbance  
which could shake dust layers off of equipment or lift dust off of the floor.•IGNITION SOURCE – Energy is required to ignite the mixture. This  may be something with as little energy as static 
electricity or a stronger energy source such  as an open flame or an electrical fault.
•CONFINEMENT – For example, the walls, ceilings, floors and roof of a building create confinement. Plant equipment 
including process equipment, storage silos, dust collectors, and ducting also creates confinement..
Sometimes an initial explosion occurs and lifts larger am ounts of dust that may have accumulated in the plant and 
disperses this dust into the air. This cr eates the conditions for a second, much larg er explosion, which can be catastrophic.
A small amount of dust – a layer as small as 1/32 inch (les s than 1 mm) thick on exposed surfaces – can create an 
explosive dust cloud once suspended. A dust layer can be considered to  create a hazardous conditi on if it covers an area, 
on all surfaces, greater than 5 % of the floor area of a room . How can you tell if there is too much dust? Two guidelines 
which people have used are that there is too much dust acc umulation (1) when you cannot te ll the color of the equipment 
or floor beneath the layer of dust, or (2) when you write your name in the dust and very slight ridges form at the edge of 
the letters. Good housekeeping is a nece ssary safe work practice when dust h azards are concern. Other safe work 
practices for dust include reducing static discharge potential through the use of grounding and bonding, proper electrical 
area classification and equipment selecti on. If your plant handles potentially explosive dusts, make sure that you 
understand the hazards, and all of the sa fe work practices and safety equi pment needed for safe operations.CCPS PSID

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - July 2008 [2008-07-Beacon-English]","An Analogy
Professor Andrew Hopkins of the Australian National Univers ity suggests the following example to show the difference 
between personal safety and process safety . An important safety concern in the airline industry is injuries to baggage 
handlers from lifting and carrying – for example, back and musc le strains (personal safety). But no airline would ever 
think that their efforts to reduce these injuries would improve flight safety (equi valent to process safety). Different 
activities and programs are required to manage these different safety concerns.
• Understand the specific hazards of the materials 
in your facility and your responsibility in the safe handling of these materials.• Understand the specific hazards of the manufacturing, storage, transport, repackaging, or other processing opera tions conducted at your 
facility.• Understand your role in process safety 
activities, including process hazard analysis, management of change, incident reporting and investigation, maintena nce and testing, and 
following safe work pr actices and procedures.Not all hazards are the same  or can cause equal conseq uences.  Personal or occu pational safety hazards
, such 
as slips, falls, cuts, and vehicle acci dents usually affect on e individual worker. On the other hand, process 
safety hazards may cause major accidents involv ing the release of potentially dangerous materials, fires and 
explosions or both. Process safety in cidents can have catastrophic effect s and can result in multiple injuries 
and fatalities, as well as substantial economic, property, and environm ental damage. Proces s safety incidents 
can harm workers inside the plant and members of the pu blic who reside nearby.  Th at is why Process safety 
management focuses on the design and engineering of f acilities, hazard assessments, incident investigation, 
management of change, inspection, testing, and mainte nance of equipment, effect ive  process controls and 
alarms, operating and maintenance procedures, training of personnel, and human factors. 
Process safety is ever ybody’s responsibility!• Good personal safety perf ormance does not ensure 
good process safety performan ce. While there is much 
in common, such as a good sa fety culture and attitude, 
good process safety performance requires a thorough understanding of the specific hazards a ssociated with the 
chemicals being handled or  stored, and the process 
operations being carried out  in a particular plant.
• Traditional safety measures such as injury  rates, lost 
time accident rates, and days  lost from work may not be 
good indicators of process safety performance. Next month’s Beacon will  discuss potentiall y useful process 
safety measures.July 2008

performance. But these tools canno t be effective unless everybody in the process industry workforce 
understands what these tools are, and why they are needed. And, most impor tant, we all have  to understand 
what our role will be in using any new process safety measurement tools. We need to understand what types of 
events we need to report, and how to report them in  our organization.
• Understand what your company is doing to 
measure process safety performance. Learn and understand the speci fic measures that 
your company is using.• Know what kinds of incidents need to be reported under your company’s process 
safety measurement program.
• Be familiar with how to report process safety incident s in your plant.
• Be diligent in re porting incidents. 
Remember that a company cannot improve process safety perfor mance if it does not 
know about incidents that  occur in the plant.
• Understand leading in dicators of process 
safety performance for your plant and how to 
report them.• Download and read the CCPS report on measuring process safety performance.The July 2008 Pro cess Safety Beac on discussed the 
meaning of “Process Safety”, an d also said that traditional 
measures of safety performance such as injury rates, lost

job we are doing on process safety. So, how can we tell 
whether or not our process sa fety management activities 
are effective? How can we tell if our performance is improving over the years?  How do we know how one 
plant, or unit in a plant, is performing compared to others? 
How will we decide where to  focus our attention so we

.
• Two types of measurements proposed – lagging indicators , 
which measure actual outcomes and past performance (the 
number of process safety inci dents which have occurred), 
and leading indicators which measure pr ocess safety 
management activities , and which are believed to be useful 
in predicting future performance .
•Lagging indicators will measure, for example, the number 
of releases of hazardous ma terial or energy from plant 
equipment, fires and explosions , and process related injuries.
•Leading indicators will measure, for example, plant 
mechanical integrity, action item follow up, management of change, and process safety training.August 2008

removal of equipment or piping from service, have a management of change review.• Make sure that all equipment in your plant which is not in routine use is either physically disconnected from active equipment and piping, or positively isolated using slip blinds or other reliable isolation systems.• Consider potential hazards of accumulation of material in pipe branches which are not routinely used, or which have low flow rates.• Be prepared for cold weather in winter. Make sure that you follow procedures to prepar e the plant for winter, to

of service during a process modification. The unused piping was not physically removed, nor was it isolated from the active piping with slip blinds. Instead, it was isolated from the connected piping by closed isolation valves.  The active piping contained liquid propane under high pressure, and the propane contained a small amount of liquid water entrained as a separate water phase. Debris jammed in the seat prevented one of the isolation valves from closing fully. This allowed wet liquid propane to leak from the active piping into the unused piping. The water, which is heavier than propane, accumulated at a

If the water is isolated in a closed piece of equipment or an isolated section of pipe, the ice formed by the freezing water causes enormous pressure and is capable of rupturing pipe and equipment.• Branch connections of process piping with little or no flow may create the same hazard of water accumulation at low points.October 2008

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - December 2008 [2008-12-Beacon-English]","A fire and series of explosions occurred in a chemical distribution 
facility. The fire started in a packaging area while a 300-gallon 
portable steel tank (a “tote”) was being filled with ethyl acetate, a flammable material (fi gure). An operator placed the fill nozzle in the 
opening on top of the tote and suspe nded a steel weight on the nozzle 
to keep it in place. As the tote was filling, the operator heard a “popping” sound and saw the tote engul fed in flames. The fill nozzle 
was laying on the floor spilli ng ethyl acetate. Employees tried 
unsuccessfully to extinguish the fire with a fire extinguisher, and then evacuated the area. The fire spr ead to a warehouse, igniting other 
stored flammable and combustible liquids. One employee received minor injuries and a firefighter was treated for a heat-related illness. Because of the smoke and rocketing barrels and debris, nearby businesses were evacuated. The warehouse was destroyed and business was interrupted.
It was determined that an ignitable vapor-air mixture formed near 
the tote fill opening. While the body of the tote, the weigh scale, and the pump were grounded, the steel parts of the fill nozzle and hose 
assembly (and the steel weight) were not bonded and grounded, and 
were isolated by the synthetic rubber fill hose. Static electricity likely accumulated on these parts and sparked to the stainless steel tote body, igniting the vapor that accumulated around the fill opening during filling.
Always ground all conductive components of  a flammable material handling system!• Static electricity is generated when liquid 
flows through pipes, valves, and other equipment• Correct bonding and grounding ensures that static electricity does not accumulate and cause a spark.• Static sparks can ignite many flammable vapor-air mixtures.•Bonding is electrically connecting

that the pictures are the sa me! Yes, this is the same 
incident. A fire started in a packaging area while a 300-
gallon portable steel tank (a  “tote”) was being filled with 
ethyl acetate. See the De cember Beacon for more 
information. In December, we discussed the im portance of 
proper bonding and grounding of  all conductiv e equipment 
to prevent static electric sparks, which can ignite a flammable atmosphere. We have often emphasized in the Beacon that all inci dents have multiple lessons, and we are 
using the same incident to make several additional points.
Note, as shown in Figure 1 (t op), that the to te was being 
filled with a shor t nozzle, and the fl ammable ethyl acetate 
dropped into the tote as a stream through the air, and 
undoubtedly also formed small dr oplets and mist particles. 
Static electric charge can be  created by liquid freely 
falling through air , and can result in sparks which can 
cause ignition of a flammable atmosphere. 
The recommended practice (by the National Fire 
Protection Association – NFPA 77) for filling portable metal tanks is to  bottom-fill,  which can be done with a dip 
pipe. You should use a slow ve locity of 1 meter per second 
(3.3 feet per second) or less until the dip pipe is submerged 
to about 150 millimeters (6 inches). Figure 2 (bottom) 
shows the recommended system.

because the initial fire spread to an adjacent flammable material storage warehouse. The wall separating the two areas was not fire-rated. Large non-fire-rated do ors between the warehouse and 
packaging area were kept open, a nd were not equipped with self-
closing mechanisms. Also there was no fire protection system (sprinklers or other fire suppression system) in the flammable material packaging area.

• Conduct flammable material cont ainer filling operations in areas 
which have been properly designe d for this service. This would 
include, for example:
• Adequate fire protection facilities• Separation of equipment, fire walls and fire rated 
doors
• Spill containment.• Proper electrical classifi cation of all equipment
• Be sure that there is proper spill containment around any containers which you are filling. The spill containment must be liquid tight, made of a material ap propriate to contain the liquid 
being handled, and of sufficient size to contain a spill which could occur.• Conduct a management of change review for any unusual operations which involve filling of containers in areas not originally designed for that purpose, and be sure to consider ignition source control, fire pr otection, and spill containment in 
this review.
Spill containment is important whenever you are filling c ontainers with any material, whether flammable or not. For 
flammable materials, containment helps to limit the area potentially impacted by a fire.  And, for all materials 
containment keeps spills from getting in to drains, sewers, surface water draina ge, or onto uncontaminated soil. While 
improper spill containment was not identified as a factor in th is particular incident, the incident is a reminder of why 
containment is important.
A Review
We have done three Beacons (December 2008, January 2009, and this issue) on a single incident which occurred while filling containers with a flammable liquid. When filling containers or other vessels with flammable liquids, you should strongly consider these safe design features:• bottom filling• grounded/bonded equipment• spill containment• inert gas in vapor space (nitrogen or carbon dioxide, for example)• liquid inlet velocity controlled until dip pipe covered• some type of emergency shutoff• sprinkler system, or other fire protection system• other features as required by codes and standards for safe handling of flammable liquids"

papers did properly identify the contents as sodium hydrosul fide. The supervisor signed the shipping papers without 
reading them and left the area. No plan t employees remained in the unloading area.
The truck driver connected his truck to a hose which was c onnected to the ferrous sulfate storage tank as shown in the 
photographs. He began to unload the sodium hydrosulfide solu tion into the ferrous sulfate tank. Unfortunately, sodium 
hydrosulfide and ferrous sulfate react to form hydrogen sulf ide, a highly toxic gas. Shortly after the unloading began, a 
plant employee in the basement of the building noti ced a pungent odor and lost consciousness. He regained 
consciousness and made his way outside  where he got help from other empl oyees, who called emergency response 
personnel. They found the truck driver unconscious inside the building, and he was pronounced dead at the scene. 
Investigators determined that the driver ha d been overcome by hydrogen sulfide gas.

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - April 2009 [2009-04-Beacon-English]","The passengers and crew of US Airways Flight 1549 from New York City to Charlotte, North Carolina expected a 
routine flight on January 15, 2009. But, approximately 2 minute s after takeoff, the plane struck a flock of birds and lost 
power in both engines. The plane was at low altitude (about 3000 f eet, 1000 meters), had no power, and was in a large 
urban area. There was danger, not only to passengers and cr ew, but to tens of thousands of people on the ground. It was 
time for the crew (Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger, First Officer Jeffrey B. Skiles, and Flight Attendants Sheila Dail, Doreen Welsh, and Donna Dent) to put everything they ha d learned from many years training and experience into 
practice, and quickly . The pilots determined that they could not re-start  the engines, and did not have sufficient altitude 
to glide to any airport. Their only option was a water landi ng in the Hudson River. The cabin crew prepared passengers 
for an emergency landing, while the pilots prepared and flew  the aircraft. The pilots succes sfully landed in the Hudson 
River west of mid-town Manhattan. All 150 passengers a nd 5 crew members safely evacuated the plane and were 
rescued by nearby commercial and rescue boats. The time from when the airplane struck the birds until it landed in the 
river was about 6 minutes !The entire crew was later awarded the Master's Medal of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air 
Navigators for “a heroic and unique aviation achievement.”

A safety instrumented system (SIS) takes automated action to  keep a plant in a safe st ate, or to put it into a 
safe state, when abnormal conditions are present. Th e SIS may implement a sing le function or multiple 
functions to protect against various process hazards in your plant. Ther e are many other names that you may 
use for this kind of a system, fo r example, safety shutdown system, emergency shutdown system, safety 
interlock, protective instrumented system, or safety cr itical system. In most cases, each function in an SIS 
consists of three components, as shown in the drawing above:
• a sensor which monitors the process to detect an upset or abnormal c ondition (for example, a 
pressure sensor)
• a logic device whic h receives the signal from th e sensor, determines if th e condition is hazardous, 
and, if so, sends a si gnal to take action
• a final control device, which receives the signal from the lo gic device and implements the 
appropriate action in the plant (for example, opening or closing a valv e, shutting down a pump)
SISs are designed at different safety integrity levels  (SILs) based on the risk po sed by the process hazard. 
The higher the SIL, the more  likely there will be multiple, redundant components (for example, more than one 
sensor, logic solver, or final el ement) and more rigorous testi ng and management requirements.

• Recognize that transferring  a flammable liquid is a 
hazardous operation with sign ificant consequences if 
something goes wrong. Monito r flammable liquid transfers 
closely so you can detect and respond to spills and leaks.• Before starting a transfer, make sure there is enough 
room in the destination tank for the material you intend to 
transfer. Check both source and destination tank level, temperature, and pressure at  frequent intervals during 
transfers, and investigate any unexpected variation in the rate of change.• When transferring liquids, estimate how much time it should take to fill the destinat ion tank at the expected flow 
rate, and investigate if the transfer takes too long.• Complete each step of the transfer procedure before moving on to the next step, and record and sign off on the procedure if required.• If you are aware of the failur e of any critical  instruments 
or alarms in your pl ant, report them immediately so they 
can be repaired.• Follow up on reported failures to make sure that repairs 
are made in a timely fashion.Coming in the October 2009 Beacon -- More lessons from this incident

• A BLEVE occurs when a vessel co ntaining liquid above its normal
boiling point and under pressure fa ils catastrophically. When the 
vessel fails, the pressure immediatel y drops to atmospheric, and the 
hot liquid rapidly boils, generating  a large quantity of vapor. The 
damage is caused by the pressure  wave from rapid expansion of the 
released vapor, and from flying pi eces of the vessel and piping. If the 
material is flammable, it can ig nite and create a large fireball.
• A BLEVE can occur for many reasons, including excessive 
pressure in the vessel, damage to a pressurized vessel from mechanical impact or corr osion, and exposure of  a pressurized vessel 
to external fire.• A vessel exposed to external fire may fail below its design pressure, 
resulting in a BLEVE, if the vapor space of the vesse l is exposed to 
flames. The flames heat and weak en the metal, causing it to fail.
• Water spray fire protection system s such as fixed deluge systems or 
fire water monitor nozzles are an e ffective way to keep vessels cool

the largest being 0.5 on the Richter Scale.
Because of the damage, the ca use of the accident was not 
definitely established. It appe ars that a large quantity of LPG 
leaked from a pipeline or tank , spilled into a walled enclosure,
and formed a flammable vapor  cloud which ignited. The 
resulting flash fire and explosio n impacted other LPG storage 
spheres, tanks, and piping, releasing additional LPG and 
exposing other tanks to fire. Many  of the explosions were of a 
type called Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosions 
(BLEVEs) . These were caused by th e failure of LPG vessels 
which had been exposed to flam es or heat from the fires.
After the incident, it was report ed that there had been many 
problems with inoperative or byp assed safety devices, a missing 
relief valve, poor hou sekeeping, and inaccurate instruments.
Be aware of the potential for a BLEVE if there is a fire in your plant!November 2009

• Reactive chemistry incidents continue to occur 
in the process industries. For example, on 
September 15, 2009, the US Chemical Safety 
and Hazard Investigation Board released a 
report on a runaway chemical reaction incident 
in Florida which killed 4 people and injured 32 
(www.csb.gov).
• The material released  from a relief valve, 
rupture disk, or other pres sure relief device must 
discharge to a safe loca tion or treatment system.
• Critical safety systems must always be 
properly maintained and fully operational.One of the worst tragedie s in the history of the 
process industries occurred 25 years ago this month. A highly toxic gas, Methyl  Isocyanate (MIC), was 
released from a pesticid e plant in Bhopal, India 
shortly after midnight on December 3, 1984. The 
number of fatalities may never be known, but 
estimates have been in th e range of 2000-4000, with 
estimated injuries of 100, 000 or more people. The 
International Medical Commission on Bhopal 
estimated that, as of 1994, more than 50,000 people 
remained partially or totall y disabled as a result of 
exposure to MIC.
Bhopal was a reactive chem istry incident.  MIC 
reacts exothermically with  water. An MIC storage 
tank was contaminated with water, and the reaction generated heat and pressure  causing a relief valve to 
open. Safety systems had b een taken out of service 
without doing a management of change evaluation, or 
they were unable to de al with the release. 
Approximately 40 tons of  highly toxic MIC was 
released into the commu nity, exposing tens of 
thousands of people

Union Carbide Bhopal PlantBhopal—A Tragic Event
It was just after midnight, 
December 3, 1984 in  
Bhopal, India.  A  succession of events  occurred in the Union 
Carbide India Limited 
facility that led to the release of ~40 metric tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC)
The basic cause has been agreed 
upon by most experts who investigated this ev ent: a significant 
quantity of water entered the  MIC 
storage tank.  Water reacted with 
MIC, temperature an d pressure rose 
and several safety systems could not deal with the event.  Eventually, the vessel's relief device lifted, 
releasing MIC vapor. ……
20 years later, the exact water 
source remains controversial.  However, it is clear that installed safety systems did NOT prevent a 
large release of toxic gas. - More than any other in the hist ory of the chemical industry, 
this incident demonstrates why ro bust safety systems are critical 
when handling hazardous materials.  This incident was also one of 
the driving forces which defined process safety management as 
we know it today.
- Understand the reactivity hazard s of all mate rials in your 
process.  Read the reactivity section of your MSDS's, fully 
understand all reactivity instructions  in your operating procedures 
and be knowledgeable about wh y your safety systems (e.g. 
interlocks, relief devices, scrubber s) are there and how they work.
- If a material in your area reacts with water: 1) be cautious
when washing equipment for maintenance or whenever a water hose is used, and 2) remember th at compressed air may contain 
condensed water – be sure process air is free of water before 
blowing lines.
- Understand the emergency proced ures you are to take if the 
temperature or pressure increa ses quickly in vessels storing 
hazardous materials, especial ly those which are reactive.
- Encourage your management a nd  technical group to have a 
discussion about the “worst case” for the facility you work in and 
what safeguards have to be main tained to prevent that scenario 
from occurring.gas.  The consequences    
were tragic:  according to the 
Indian government, more than 3800 people died shortly after the release and thousands were 
injured. ………………......……….

and your role in ensuring that these programs are effective.• Observe pipes, vessels, and other equipment when you are working in the plant. Look for stains on the outside of insulated  lines and other si gns of damaged or corroded 
equipment. Follow up to make sure that repairs are made.• If you are taking equipment or piping apart, look for evidence of corrosion damage – for example, corrosion under insulation, internal corrosion in pipes or other equipment, damage to flanges or valves. • When replacing pipes, valves, or other equipment, be careful to use the same material of construction.

•Corrosion is the deterioration of metal by electro-
chemical reaction with substances or microbes in its environment. These substances can be process materials contained in a vessel, pipe, or other equipment, or materials 
in the outside environment – for  example, water, salt, or 
contaminants in the atmosphere. The rusting of steel is an example of corrosion.•Erosion Corrosion
is the degradation of material surface 
due to mechanical action, often by impinging liquid, abrasion by a slurry, or particles, bubbles, or droplets suspended in fast flowing liquid or gas.• Corrosion has been responsible for major losses in the process industries. For example, in 2006, part of a major oil field had to be shut down fo r several months because of 
multiple oil spills resulting from severe pipeline corrosion.Mechanical integrity is one of the biggest challenges for an 
effective process safety manageme nt program. Think about it – in 
your plant, there may be hundreds of vessels, thousands of feet of 
pipe, and hundreds of pumps, compre ssors, instruments, and other
equipment. All of it must be kept in good operating condition to
ensure safe, reliable, and profit able operation. Management of 
corrosion and erosion of process piping and equipment must be a 
major component of any effectiv e mechanical integrity program.
The pictures show some examples of corrosion and erosion 
problems which were identified in  plant inspections. (1) and (2) –
external corrosion of pipes in a plant; (3) – close up of erosion 
damage to the face of a flange; (4) – close up of eroded body and 
seat of a gate valve; (5) – ero sion damage on the body of a valve.

What do these dates have in common:  December 7, 1941, November 
22, 1963, September 11, 2001? They are all dates of events which everybody in the United States will always remember. Unfortunately they were tragedies – the attack on Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President Kennedy, and the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York. These are dates that we remember in the United States. In your culture or country the dates and events will be different and those above may be less memorable – after all much of the rest of the world had been at war for several years before December 1941,  and many other countries have 
suffered major terrorist attacks. Th ink about the important dates in your 
history and why you remember them.
What about July 20, 1969? Do you know that date?  It’s the day that the 
first man walked on the moon. That was a more glorious day in history but 
perhaps not as well remembered. Why? Psychologically, we tend toremember the bad things more than  the good.  Remembering the bad can 
cause us pain or sense of loss, but we continue to remember.
It is the same with serious process events. Next month, it will be 5 
years since the explosion at a refinery in Texas City, Texas, which killed 15 people and injured 180. There are dates in every company’s history that are remembered for serious events. Is  there a ceremony to reflect on their 
anniversary? Probably not, but they ar e as important as the release of the 
most successful products. Remembering them can be a painful experience, especially for those who lost close friends and coworkers, but we must remember so we can work to make sure these tragedies never happen again.

Five years ago, on March 23, 2005, a series of explosions 
occurred at an oil refi nery in Texas City, Texa s during the restart of a 
hydrocarbon isomerization unit. 15 workers were killed and 180 were 
injured. All fatalities and many of the injuries occurred in and around trailers that had been placed near  the isomerization unit to support 
maintenance activities on other units. A distillation column wasoverfilled and overpressurized. The relief valve opened, releasing hot hydrocarbon to the atmosphere through a vent stack to the 
atmosphere. This was not the first time a release had occurred from 
the vent stack, but this time th e release was much larger. The 
resulting flammable vapor cloud ign ited causing a massive explosion.
This incident highlights the import ance of the locat ion of occupied 
buildings, both permanent and temporary, relative to highly 
hazardous processing facilities. In response to industry and public 
concern, the American Petroleum Institute (API) has created or 
updated two Recommended Practices  on management of hazards 
associated with permanent (RP752 ) and portable (RP753) buildings.

that people working in the plant have to contribute. For example:
• Understand your plant’s facility s iting studies. Know which areas

buildings are actually used. For example, management may believe that a local control hu t in the plant is used  
infrequently, but operators may know that it is actually regularly occu pied for long periods of time.  
• Don’t seek refuge from a potential explos ion in a building that is not designed for a blast. An explosion creates 
a pressure wave, and buildings which are not built to withst and an explosion are likely to be heavily damaged or 
completely destroyed. A person is more  likely to be injured by the collapse of a building which is not blast 
resistant than by th e same pressure wave  in an open area. 
• As soon as you become aware of a flammable material release which could create a flammable vapor cloud, 
follow your plant’s emergency procedur es, including sounding evacuation al arms to ensure that non-essential 
personnel evacuate process un its and nearby buildings.
• Assure that nonessential personnel are not allowed in the process area du ring high hazard operations - for 
example, plant star t-up, emergency shutdown, plant upsets.
• Insist that process upsets that result in hazardous ma terial releases are properly investigated and corrective 
actions taken.

Would you recognize the metal cover (yellow arrow) in Picture 1 as an important piece of safety 
equipment? If it was damaged or missing, would you know to report it so that it  could be repaired or 
replaced?
The metal cover wraps something called a “long bolt flangeless valve” (also called long bolt, 
sandwich, flangeless, or wafer valves). Some exampl es, with the covers remove d, are circled in red in 
Pictures 2 and 3. These valves have no integral flange s for bolting to pipe or vessel flanges, and have 
exposed bolts longer than 3 inches (about 7 cm.). If there is a fire in  the area, the long bolts may be 
contacted directly by flames (impingement). The heat causes the bolts to expand and lengthen, 
allowing the gaskets on the two side s of the valve to leak. If the le aking material is flammable or 
combustible, it will add fuel to th e fire (Picture 4). If the pipe is under pressure, a large, spraying fire 
that results in more damage can occur.
The metal cover wraps the long bolts with a fire re sistant material and enclos es the entire assembly 
with a stainless steel covering to pr otect it from flame and heat impinge ment. It is an important safety 
device. It must be properly re-ins talled if removed for maintenan ce. It must also be inspected 
periodically to be sure it is in good condition, and any damage must be report ed so it can be repaired.

The April 2010 Beacon discusse d the use of fireproofing to protect process piping  components, specifically 
long bolt flangeless valves. Fi reproofing is a fire resistant insulating material which is  also often applied to the 
surface of structural st eel to delay heating of  that steel from fire  exposure. The primary purpose is to improve 
the capability of structural steel to maintain its integrity  until the fire is either exti nguished or other active fire 
protection systems can prov ide adequate cooling protect ion. Without fireproofing, exposed structural steel, 
such as the pipe rack  support columns in the photog raph at left, or the support co lumns in the photograph on 
the right, can rapidly lose strength and fail, possibly within minutes. The failure of the piping and equipment 
supports can break pipes or cause vesse ls to fail, releasing more flammabl e material, and causing a larger fire.
Take care of fireproofed structural steel so it can take care of you!May 2010

part of your routine plant safety inspections. Look for physical damage, spilled material, accumulation of rain water in dikes, or blocked drainage. Look for debris, equipment, or anything whic h restricts flow of a spill.
• Make sure that your plant procedures include pumping out or draining rain water from containment dikes – if a dike is partly filled with rain  water, it may not be able to 
contain a large spill.• If you have any kind of valves or other piping to remove rain water from a containment dike, make sure these are closed or otherwise blocked when not being used.• If you do any maintenance or construction work on a storage dike which results in damage to the integrity of the dike, make sure the damage is repaired before the job is finished.What can you do?ÅSpill containment dikes for

Other examples of damage incl ude cracks in dike walls or

spilled material to flow out of the dike area. Most people recognize that containment dikes around storage tanks, and sloped 
containment pads for pumps, process build ings and structures, truck and rail car 
unloading areas, and other potential spill locations have an important environmental protection function – preventing contamination of soil and surface water.  But, do you 
know that they often also have important  safety functions? Some examples include:
• limiting the spread of a fire and prev enting exposure of other equipment if a 
flammable material spills and is ignited• preventing contact of incompatible reactiv e materials in case of leak or spill
• limiting the spread of spilled corrosive material and preventing contact with equipment which could be damaged by contac t with the corrosive material
In 2001, the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) investigated 
a fire that destroyed a petroleum blending facility in Texas. Poor dike design and maintenance resulted in burning liquid spread ing the fire from tank to tank, eventually 
engulfing the whole plant."

any sensors or moving part s, it does require ongoing 
inspection and maintenance. As shown in the previous 
three issues of the Beacon , insulation can be removed 
from equipment or it can de teriorate or be damaged; 
fireproofing can be damaged or  removed; dike walls can 
have holes in them; and other types of passive safety equipment can deteriorate or be damaged.• It is easy to forget about pa ssive safety equipment, and 
to forget its importance for pl ant safety because it is just 
part of the plant background that you see as  you go about 
your job, and you neve r notice its condition.April – Insulating cover on a          May – damaged fireproofing         June – a hole in the wall of a

Can you figure out what the April, May, and June 2010 issues of the Process Safety Beacon have in 
common?  All of them discuss a type of safety  equipment that can gener ally be described as passive . Passive 
safety devices do not have to detect  an unsafe condition or take any action  to perform their protective safety 
function. They have no sensors or moving parts. They do their job be cause of their construction – for 
example, the insulating characteristics and thickness of insulation or fireproof ing, or the height and 
impervious material of c onstruction of a dike wall.
Here are some other exam ples of passive safety equipment wh ich you might have in your plant:  
containment buildings for toxic materi als, blast resistant control rooms or other buildings, blast resistant 
buildings for storage of potentially unst able materials such as organic peroxi des, flame or detonation arrestors, 
insulation on storage tanks to limit he at exposure to a fire (standards for sizing relief valves for preventing 
overpressure of a storage tank e ngulfed in a fire al low credit for insulation on the tank).
What can you do?
• Find out what kind of pa ssive safety equipment 
you have in your plant,  and understand what 
safety function it performs.• Find out what must be  done to maintain the 
passive safety equipment in your plant, and make 
sure these maintenance activities are done. Ask 
the people responsible fo r maintenance to explain 
the required maintenance.• Learn how to recognize damage to the passive 
safety equipment in your plant so you can report it 
and have it repaired.• Periodically include inspection of passive safety 
equipment in your plant safety inspections."
"Process Safety Beacon (English) - September 2010 [2010-09-Beacon-English]","What is Process Safety Information (PSI)? It is the information 
about the process chemistry, e quipment and technology of your 
plant. It is collected from many  places inside and outside your 
company: research and developmen t, engineering, operations, and 
also suppliers of raw materials, process technology, and equipment. As an operator or maintenance pe rson, your  first exposure to the 
PSI may have been at a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The PSI was that stack of drawings, manuals, documents, and books that provided information to the PHA team . PSI is also frequently used 
in Management of Change (MOC) reviews. It is important to understand the existing system so you can evaluate the consequences of proposed changes. For example, a new valve must meet the specifications for the pipe where it is installed. Thatmeans the valve, gaskets, bolts, and other components all need to be correct. How do you know? Verify them according to the pipingspecifications in the PSI from the plant engineering design. 
Some other important examples of PSI include piping and 
instrumentation drawings (1),  hazardous area classification 
drawings (2), and the reports from process hazard analyses (3), management of change reviews, incident investigations, personal protective equipment requiremen ts, operating and maintenance 
procedures, and others.

PSI is essential to safe plant operatio n and maintenance, but it is  valuable only if it is correct, up to date,  and 
used. And you must know where to find it! Here are some examples of things you can do to ensu re that the PSI 
for your plant is correct, an d we are sure yo u can think of many other examples:
• If asked to go into the pl ant and update piping drawin gs, take that job seriously . A valve not shown on the 
drawing may be the differe nce in preventing a spill – you can’t close it if yo u don’t know it is there!
• If you find that an operation is normally done differently from the writte n operating procedure, tell your 
supervisor, so that either the procedure is modified, or the operation is done as requ ired by existing procedures.
• If you find an error on a drawing, tell your superv isor or plant engineer so it can be corrected.
• If you are trying to use a drawing and there are too many corrections, tell your supervisor or  an engineer that 
the corrections make the drawing conf using, and a new drawing is needed.
• Remember that control system documentation is part of  the PSI and must be updated when changes are made."
"Process Safety Beacon (English) - October 2010 [2010-10-Beacon-English]","• Make sure that all c ontainers from small sample jars all the wa y up to railroad tank cars and other large 
containers are clearly labeled so th at everybody knows what is in them.
• Label laboratory and plant waste cont ainers as to what can and CANNOT be discarded in the same container.
• Do not allow packaged wastes to be stored for extended pe riods of time at your site
• When preparing materials for shipment , make sure that you understand all of the re quirements for safely 
shipping those materials, including proper containers, packaging, labeli ng, shipping pape rs and any other 
requirements.• Inspect containers BEFORE filling them with haza rdous materials. Look for potential leak points.
• Know the requirements for safe storage of materials in  warehouses or other storag e areas, and follow them.
• Follow your plant procedures for r eceiving hazardous materi als including shipping papers or container

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - November 2010 [2010-11-Beacon-English]","1 – Gas leaked from the proc ess through the stem of a 10 inch gear operated 
valve into the gear operator. The gear op erator was designed to relieve gas if 
this happened, but the relief system did not work. The gear operator became pressurized and a 5 inch plate blew off the top of the valve operator. 
Fortunately, nobody was hit by the plate.  The investigation found that the 
relief vent on the valve operator (and another one on a ne arby valve) had 
been painted over (arrow) and it did not  vent properly. Plant personnel were 
not aware of the potential for gas migr ation into the gear  box, and the need 
to verify that the operator gear box wa s properly vented.

– A natural gas pressure reducing system  used the natural gas to operate a 
control valve. The valve actuator ruptured, and a large fragment went flying several meters. We do not have enough in formation on this incident to know 
whether the valve actuator was over pressured, or if it was corroded, 
damaged, or otherwise defe ctive, but these are possibl e causes of the failure. 
Again, fortunately, nobody was hit by the pieces of the failed valve actuator.
• It is possible for pressurized process gases and other fluids to leak from 
the process into valve actuators. The resulting pressure may be sufficient to cause the actuator to fail.
• Some equipment (for example, the valve actuator in Incident 1 above) 
includes small vent openin gs or relief plugs which s hould never be blocked, 
plugged with debris, or painted over.• Some valves and other instruments may use process gases as the source of 
pressure to activ ate the devices.
• Any device under pressure, including  valve actuators, can fail and 
potentially cause injury if it is subjected  to excess pressure by mis-operation 
or improper maintenance practices.
• For all equipment that can be pres surized, understand how the high pressure relief systems are intended to 
function. Don’t forget equipm ent such as valve actuators, especially if they use pr ocess gas for motive power.
• Make sure that you have complete documentation of  excess pressure relief sy stems, and know how to 
recognize if they are no t working properly or are compromised in some way.
• Many maintenance operations such as painting and insulation are don e by contractors or  temporary workers 
who do not understand the plant. They may inadvertently compromise safety , for example by painting over the 
valve operator vent as described above,  or by insulating  over the stem of a valve preventing movement. Assume 
that these workers do not understand the equipment and gi ve them specific training on how to do the job before 
they start any work . Observe their work, and inspect the equipment that they have worked  on before putting it

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - December 2010 [2010-12-Beacon-English]","It is time to be are ready for cold weather!  Winter weather can cause major problems for 
process plants. Some examples:• Water pipes can freeze, possibly causing loss of  critical cooling water flow or damaging fire 
protection systems using water.• Condensate lines from steam traps can freeze causing the traps to be ineffective.• Some process materials can freeze at winter temperatures, or solids may precipitate from process solutions, causing loss of flow and requiring maintenance operations to clear blocked pipes or equipment.• Incoming raw materials may arrive frozen, or w ith solid precipitated from a solution in the 
bottom of the transport container (drum, truck, railroad car, ISO container). Note that this may 
be a concern even if your plant is in a place wh ich does not have cold winter temperatures – the 
shipment may have passed through cold weather on the way to your plant, frozen, and not had 
enough time to thaw before arrival.
• Don’t forget about the physical hazards of ice and snow – the possibility of slips and falls. 
And look for places where large icicles or heavy accumulations of ice might form – for example on structures near steam vents, near cooling towers, or where water spray fire protection systems have been activated.• Remember that water expands when it freezes. The pressure from the ice can be enough to break pipes and rupture or damage process equipment.• You can get short periods of cold weather even  in areas which normally have mild winters –
be prepared for this possibility.
• Read the December 2001 and October 2008 issues of  the Beacon for some examples of winter 
weather process safety problems (“read only” copies available at www.sache.org).
• Have a “winterization” checklist to ensure that your plant is ready for cold weather. It s hould include things such as 
checking that steam or electric tracing of pipes and equipment is turned on and working, insulation is in good condition, 
heating systems in warehouses are working, safety showers a nd eye wash stations are prepared for cold weather, anti-
freeze protection of engi ne driven equipment such as fi re water pumps, and other things  appropriate to your plant.
• Review procedures for thawing frozen pipes and equipment,  and incoming raw materials which might freeze in cold 
weather, and make sure you understand them. Think about this even if you are in a warm climate – do you receive 
materials which could freeze on the way to your plant?• Review non-routine activities and jobs for cold weather impact.
• Be ready for thawing temperatures, when leaks may appear, or ice accumulations on piping and structures may fall to the ground.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - January 2011 [2011-01-Beacon-English]","A vapor cloud explosion occurs  when a sufficient amount of 
flammable or combustible material is  released, mixes with air, and is 
ignited. Some causes of  the release of the vapor  or gas fuel include:
• Loss of process containm ent from failure of a pipe, reactor, storage 
tank, or other process vessel cont aining flammable or combustible 
liquid, or a flammable gas.• Rapid discharge of flammable va por to the atmosphere through a 
pressure relief system.
• Release of flammable liquid stor ed under pressure – for example, 
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Th e discharged liquid will rapidly 
boil at atmospheric pressure, fo rming a flammable vapor cloud.
If the flammable vapor cloud is i gnited, it can explode, producing 
a blast wave which can cause major destruction at a large distance. 
This is particularly true for releas es in congested or  confined areas, 
for vapor clouds that have drifted into such areas, and for reactive 
materials. In addition, heat from  the fireball can cause significant 
injury or damage.
Some of the worst disast ers in the history of the process industries 
have been vapor cloud explos ions. Some examples include:
• June 1974, Fli xborough, England (28 fatalities)
• October 1989, Houston, Texas (23 fatalities)• March 2005, Texas City, Texas (15 fatalities)• December 2005, Buncefie ld, England (no fatalitie s but 43 injuries 
and major damage)• October 2009, Jaipur, India (12 fatalities)
• Make sure that piping and equipm ent inspections and preventive maintenance tasks are completed as 
required to ensure mechanical integrity  of process equipment. Containment of  fuel is the best way to prevent 
vapor cloud explosions. Ignition so urces for flammable vapor clouds – f or example, heat ers, vehicles, 
unclassified electrical areas, hot work, static discharge – are difficult to control. 
• Ensure that safe work practices are followed, including hot work pr ocedures in areas  near flammable 
inventories.• If you detect any leak, no matter how small, on equipment containing flammable or combustible liquid or 
flammable vapor, report it im mediately and know how to in itiate emergency procedures.
• If your plant contains flammable or  combustible materials, you should have written emergency procedures 
for a leak. Review and unde rstand these procedures, participate in drills, and know what you must do to 
protect yourself and others in case of a leak. Know when and how to use appropriate personal protective 
equipment (for example, flame resistant clothing) and le ak detection equipment such  as portable flammable 
material detectors.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

nobody was injured. The incident showed that it was criti cal to avoid leaks of the nitrate salt, to detect 
leaks if they did occur, and to have a sa fe shutdown procedure if there was a leak.
While this incident involved a relatively reactive heat transfer fluid (nit rate salt), many process 
materials can react with common heat transfer fluids  such as water, steam, brine solutions, ethylene

ÎImmediately report any leak that you observe in the course of your work. Signs of a leak include 
puddles, drips, discolored paint or insulation, and unus ual odors. Follow up to ma ke sure that the leak 
is repaired in a timely manner.
ÎIdentify leaking material and foll ow your plant procedures to ensure  safety until the leak can be 
repaired. Some examples:  confine or absorb the leaking material, drain it to a safe place, set up 
warning signs or barricades to warn people of the hazard and keep th em away, make sure that ignition 
sources are eliminated if the leaki ng material is flammable or com bustible. Your plant emergency and 
leak procedures will include specific actions appropriate for the materials in your plant.
ÎRecognize that it may take time to  prepare the plant for maintenance to repair the leak – pipes or 
vessels may have to be emptied, equipment may have to be shut down, equipment may have to be 
isolated from the area where work is  to be done. Monitor the leak fro m a safe location until it can be 
repaired, so appropriate actions can be  taken if the leak increases in size.
ÎWhen monitoring or inspecting equipment norma lly hidden from view (fo r example, covered by 
insulation), look for evidence of leaks and repor t your observations so repairs can be made.
…become a BIG leak! Æ
a leak of any material can be 
dangerous. A small leak of a very toxic 
material can be immediately dangerous, 
and a small leak of a flammable or less toxic material may grow rapidly, and 
become large enough that it is a major 
fire, explosion, or health hazard.

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - May 2011 [2011-05-Beacon-English]","ÎUnderstand the fire and explosio n hazards of th e materials in 
your plant. Don’t forget  about natural gas, pr opane, and other fuels!
ÎWhen purging equipment and pi ping (for example, when 
preparing equipment for mainte nance), make sure flammable 
materials are vented to a safe lo cation, away from personnel and
ignition sources. Follow your plant procedures for safely purging 
flammable materials.ÎWhenever possible, purge flammable vapors and gases to  
collection systems which go to flar es, scrubbers, or other treatment 
systems. Avoid purging indoors,  and conduct a thorough hazard 
analysis to identify job specific precautions to protect personnel if this is unavoidable.ÎUse flammable gas detectors to monitor areas where flammable 
materials may be vented or purged.
In June 2009 ther e was a major explosion at a meat 
processing plant in Garner, North Carolina, USA.  A new 
natural gas line had been insta lled to supply fuel to a water 
heater. The new pipe was bei ng purged with natural gas to 
remove air. The natural gas from  the purge was released into 
a building intermittently ove r a 2 ½ hour period. An 
explosive mixture formed a nd ignited. The explosion 
destroyed the building, killed 4 workers, injured 67 people, and caused a release of 18, 000 pounds of ammonia. 
Most people would recognize natural gas as a fuel which 
could cause an explosion. But remember that the release of 
any flammable gas or volatile flammable liquid
from piping 
or equipment has the potential to cause a similar incident.
Many manufacturing processe s use flammable gases or 
liquids, and most factories, offices, and laboratories use 
natural gas, propane, or other flammable fuels. In preparation 
for maintenance, start-up, or other work, it may be necessary 
to purge the flammable process material or fuel from the 
pipes or equipment. This in cident reminds us of the 
importance of purging that flamma ble material to  a safe place 
where it can be safely  contained, treated, or dispersed. Never 
allow flammable materials to a ccumulate in a building, room, 
or any other confined space.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

People are not designed for irregular  sleep patterns. Shift workers 
face frequent sleep disturbances which can cause excessive sleepiness. You can minimize the effects. Some examples:
ÎMake sure you get enough quality sleep while you are away from 
work.
ÎMake sure you have a good place to  sleep during the day – dark, 
quiet, without disturbances.
ÎTake a nap immediately before you go to work.
ÎWork with others to help keep you alert.
ÎBe active – take walks and move around as much as possible.
ÎDon’t plan tedious or difficult tasks when you are likely to be 
most tired. Studies show that night shift workers are most sleepy around 4-5 AM.
ÎIf you are having problems staying awake, consult a doctor. You
may have a sleep condition that can be remedied.

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - August 2011 [2011-08-Beacon-English]","On February 7, 2010, six workers were killed and at least 50 others were injured in a natural gas explosion at a power 
plant under construction in Middletown, Connecticut, USA. Th e explosions resulted from planned work activities that led 
to large releases of flammable natural gas in  the presence of workers and ignition sources.
At the time of the incident, workers were conducting a ""gas blow ,"" in which natural gas is forced through the piping at 
a high pressure and volume to remove debris, part of the commissioning and startup phase of the project. Natural gas was being blown from an open-ended pipe be tween two large structures in an area near the power generation building (1). 
This location, while outdoors, was cong ested because of surrounding power generation equipment (2). Efforts were made 
to eliminate or control potential ignition  sources in the area. However, ignition sources remained, both outside and inside 
the building. The released natural gas found an ignition source and exploded (3).
This incident occurred during construc tion and startup of a power plant, and involved a large amount of flammable 
gas. However, it is not uncommon for many kinds of process plants to be required to vent flammable liquid or vapor 
from piping or equipment for maintena nce or shutdown. Recent Beacons (Janua ry and May 2011) have  discussed vapor 
cloud explosions outdoors and inside build ings. This incident is another example.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

- Check the outside for corrosion or signs of leakage. Metal 
braided hoses which have frayed or corroded braids should be replaced.
- Be sure that you are able to see the entire outside of the hose
when you inspect it. Is part of  the hose covered by something which 
keeps you from seeing  damage? 
- Look inside to make sure the hose is clean, and not blocked.
- Check that seals (gaskets or O-rings) are in good condition.- Check that the fittings which connect a hose are not damaged.
ÎMake sure that hoses are inspected or replaced as required by your 
plant’s maintenance schedule.
ÎReview your plant’s procedures fo r ensuring that the material of 
construction of hoses is correct.
ÎMake sure you use the correct hose – particularly that it is the 
correct material of construction a nd pressure rating. Don't improvise!
ÎMake sure hoses are properly and securely connected to piping, and 
properly supported. Long, heavy hoses are particularly vulnerable.
ÎProperly clean and store hoses to prevent contamination or damage.
ÎProtect hoses from damage where vehicles could  run over them.
Hoses can be a significant hazard in a process plant. They must be properly maintained, stored, and inspec ted. Here are some examples of 
incidents caused by hose failure:¾An unloading hose on a chlorine ra ilroad tank car failed (top and middle 
pictures) because of corrosion. It w as found that the hose was not made of 
the correct material. It was stainless steel instead of the specified Hastelloy C, a metal alloy. Nearly 25 tons of  chlorine was released, 63 neighbors 
sought medical attention, hundreds had to shelter in place, and a highway 
was closed.¾A hose used to unload cylinders of phosgene, a highly toxic gas, failed 
(bottom picture). A worker was exposed and later died in the hospital. The 
hose was made of the specified material of construction, although company engineers had recommended changing to a different material. It was found that an adhesive tag on the hose trapped phosgene which slowly diffused from inside the hose through the plastic hose core. This caused 
faster corrosion under the label, a nd that is where the failure occurred.
¾There are many reports of  dirty hoses causing contamination of process 
equipment, product contamination, and dangerous chem ical reactions.
¾If a hose is blocked with solid materi al, it will pressurize up to the line 
pressure. If the blockage breaks free, a projectile could be released causing significant damage, or, if the hose is worn or weakened, it could burst.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

He realized his error, reset the PLC circuit breaker and turned off the intended circuit breaker. The short power interruption to the PLC caused some process equipment to stop while other equipment continued to operate. The result was a process trying to run with partial controls. The process operation was upset, isolation valves closed, and toxic material was vented  at a rate that overloaded a vent scrubber. Fortunately, no one was injured and the release did not leave the plant site.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

The pictures show improperly bolted flanges that a 
plant found during safety inspections. In the top pictures, some or all of the bolts are too short, and the nuts are not completely on the bolts. This means that the joint may not be as strong as it should be. Flanges are designed so that the entire nut-bolt combination holds the forces on the flange. If the nut is only partially screwed onto the bolt, the connection may not be strong enough.

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - March 2012 [2012-03-Beacon-English]","What can you do?
The December 2011 Beacon described an incident where a missing plug on a vent line 
resulted in a flammable material leak which caught fire, causing a fatality. That incident 
reminded us of the importance of caps and pl ugs on process vent lines and drains. How-
ever, sometimes vents or drains should not be capped or plugged. Some (but not all!) uses 
of a “double block and bleed” isolation system may be examples. For example, the vent on 
a double block and bleed used to stop material flow by a safety shutdown system most likely needs to be open when th e plant is in operation. But, be careful – sometimes the 
bleed from a double block and bleed should be capped or plugged. This may be the case 
for a double block and bleed used only to isol ate equipment for maintenance, which may 
only be open during maintenance isolation. Understand your app lication and how to 
operate it correctly!
How does a double block and bleed work?
A double block and bleed is often used for a more positive isolation of a process fluid 
from other equipment. It normally consists of  two block valves (Valves 1 and 2 in the 
pictures) and a bleed valve (Valve 3) to a sa fe location, consistent  with local environ-
mental regulations. When the process fluid is feeding the downstream equipment, the 
valves are set as shown in Picture 1, with th e isolation valves 1 a nd 2 open, and the bleed 
valve 3 closed. When the downstream equipment is to be isolated from the process fluid, 
the valves are set as shown in Picture 2, w ith isolation valves 1 and 2 closed, and bleed 
valve 3 open. If isolation valve 1 leaks, or is  accidently opened, the fluid will be prevented 
from flowing to the downstream equipment by the second isolation valve 2. There will be 
no pressure accumulation between the two isol ation valves because leaking or trapped 
material will flow to “a safe place” through the bleed valve 3.
When might it be used?
Some uses of double block and bleed include:
• In some automatic shutdown systems, to stop material flow, such as in some fuel gas 
systems for burners.• To provide isolation of hazardous material, temperature, or pressure during equipment 
maintenance or temporary shutdown.• To isolate steam heat from a batch process wher e it is required in some steps, but heating 
can be hazardous in other process steps.• To isolate process material feeds which ar e required for some operations but which can 
be hazardous if fed during other operations.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

For an automatic safety shutdown system, the bleed is often not  plugged, but check with your plant engineers to be sure.
Know what may be vented through the bleed, and be sure that it vents to a safe place. Your plant engineers will have to

A delivery truck arrived at a plant with a 
solution of nickel nitrate and phosphoric acid, named “Chemfos 700”  by the supplier. A plant employee directed the truck driver to the unloading location, and sent a pipefitter to help unload. The pipefitter opened a pane l containing 6 pipe 
connections (Picture 1), each to a different storage tank. Each unloading connection was labeled with the plant’s name for the material stored in the tank. The truck driver told the pipefitter that he was delivering Chemfos 700. 
Unfortunately, the pipefitter connected the truck 
unloading hose to the pipe adjacent to the Chemfos 
700 pipe, labeled “Chemfos Liq. Add.” (Picture 2). 
The “Chemfos Liq. Add.” tank contained a solution of sodium nitrite. Sodium nitrite reacts with Chemfos 700 to produce nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, both toxic gases. Minutes after unloading began, an orange cloud was seen near the storage tank (Picture 3). Unloading was stopped immediately, but gas continued to be released. 2,400 people were evacuated, and 600 residents were told to shelter in place. 6 people were treated for injuries from breathing toxic gas, and the cost was nearly $200,000.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

This incident was investigated by the United States National 
Transportation Safety Board (Accident No. DCA99MZ003, November 19, 1998). Some contributing causes included:
ÎThe piping connections and hose couplings were identical, 
and the pipe labels were similar.
ÎUnloading procedures had been changed, and the pipefitter 
had not been trained on the modifications.
ÎThe pipefitter was not aware of existing written procedures.
ÎNobody double checked that the truck was connected to the 
correct pipe before starting to unload.
Some additional concerns, not specifically mentioned in the 
investigation report, include:
ÎTwo materials with very similar names reacted to release a 
toxic gas when mixed.
ÎMaterials which can react to form a toxic gas were 
unloaded in the same area.
What can you do?
ÎKnow about any hazardous reactions which can occur if 
materials in your plant are accidentally mixed.
ÎWhen unloading materials from a shipping container, 
check, then double check, to make sure it contains the material you think it does, and that it is connected to the correct storage tank.
ÎMake sure unloading pipe connections are clearly 
labeled, including the use of a code or numbering system to avoid confusion of materials with similar names.
ÎIf materials which can react hazardously are unloaded in 
the same area, or unloading locations are confusing, inform management and suggest how this could be improved. For example, you could separate unloading locations, use different types of unloading connections, or use special valve locking systems to make improper connection more difficult.
ÎEnsure that unloading is done by trained and qualified 
workers, and manage any change in procedures.1 2

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - June 2012 [2012-06-Beacon-English]","This Beacon is not focused on a single incident, but on incidents that continue 
to  occur across industry – nitrogen asphyxiation. A June 2003 United States Chemical Safety Board (CSB) bulletin reported nitrogen asphyxiation incidents 
in US industry resulting in 80 deaths from 1992 to 2002.  These incidents occurred in many different workplaces – industrial plants , laboratories, and 
medical facilities. Many of the incidents involved contractors. The pictures are some examples of the kind of places where a dangerous concentration of nitrogen could accumulate, taken from CSB reports.
While nitrogen itself is not toxic, a high nitrogen concentration in the air you 
breathe will starve your body of the oxygen needed to sustain life. 78% of the air we normally breathe is nitrogen, and  oxygen makes up most of the rest. People cannot function well when the nitrogen c oncentration is more than 84% (16% 
oxygen). Your judgment may be impaired  and you may not recognize that you 
are in danger! At 94% nitrogen concentration, death is likely in a few breaths.
On the positive side, nitrogen is an in ert gas which reduces fire potential by 
eliminating the oxygen required for a fire . For this reason nitrogen is commonly 
used to purge piping and equipment used in flammable material service. http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

April 15, 2012 marked the 100thanniversary of the loss of the 
ocean liner Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately 2 ½ 
hours 
after hitting an iceberg. Over 1,500 people died in the most

operating issues, attention to one pa rticular issue could have saved 
many lives – Emergency Preparation! 
Some specific failures in emer gency preparedness before the 
sinking of the Titanic included:
•Not enough lifeboats for all passenge rs and crew, perhaps because 
the builders considered the ship “unsinkable”!
•No lifeboat drills had been conduc ted, and many people did not 
know where to go or what to do.
•Many of the first lifeboats to leave the Titanic were not  full and 
some occupants were reluctant to pull other people from the icy water for fear of capsizing their lifeboat.
•The decision to abandon ship was delayed while the captain and crew assessed damage. Had the captain started evacuation earlier, before people began to panic, more  lifeboats may have been filled 
in a more orderly evacuation. http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

Hot work is any work that can be a source of 
ignition when flammable material is present, or which can be a direct fire hazard even if flammable material is not present.
Here are some examples of hot work: welding, 
soldering, cutting metals, brazing, grinding, drilling.
Most countries have regulations requiring safety 
permits for hot work.
There are industry standards from groups such as 
the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the American Welding Society, the American Petroleum Institute (API), and others, which describe safe procedures for hot work.
If your job requires that you issue hot work permits, 
you must be properly trained on your plant requirements and procedures before you can issue any hot work permits.
Many hot work incidents occur because the presence 
of flammable material was not anticipated. Flammable vapors flowed into the area or equipment where the work was being done by a route which had not been expected.
Insufficient flammable vapor monitoring of the 
atmosphere in vessels or other equipment, or in the general work area, is also a frequent contributing cause to hot work incidents."

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - October 2012 [2012-10-Beacon-English]","This incident has several things in common with the June 1974 
explosion in Flixborough, England (June 2004 Process Safety 
Beacon ). The Flixborough explosion killed 28 workers, injured 36, 
and had a major impact on process safety management systems and regulations throughout the world. The pipe which failed at Flixborough was much larger, but some common characteristics of  this incident and the Flixborough explosion include:
•A management of change review was not done for a temporary piping modification.
•The temporary piping did not follow appropriate engineering standards, and the piping was not properly supported.
•Stress on temporary piping was one factor in the failure.
ÎFollow your plant’s Management of Change procedure 
for allmodifications of piping, equipment, and procedures.
ÎRemember that temporary modifications require the 
same thorough analysis as permanent changes. 
ÎNever make changes to piping or equipment without 
review by qualified experts to assure that the change follows engineering standards and good practice. 
ÎFollow recommendations from the manufacturer of 
your equipment.
ÎIf “temporary” modifications are made to a plant, they 
should have an “expiration dat e”, and be removed before 
that date. You should do anot her management of change 
review for removal of the temporary installation. Don’t let a temporary change become permanent without review!
ÎIf you see equipment in your plant which is no longer 
used or needed, suggest that it be removed!
A filter on the suction of a pump frequently plugged. Because of 
this, the pressure needed to be mon itored, both in the field and at the 
control panel. To minimize installation time for a pressure transmitter, it was decided to install a tap on the existing connection for the local pressure gauge and connect a pressure transmitter to this tap. Because of the rush and the temporary nature of the change, it was decided to use tubing for the change. The installation, though accepted as a temporary installation, did not follow appropriate design codes or engineering standards, and no manage ment of change review was done. 
Approximately three years later, the tubing ruptured and 
combustible material at a temperature of 360° C leaked to the atmosphere. The leaking material ignited and started a major fire which destroyed the plant.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

Why did it happen?
ÎThe temporary installation did not follow appropriate 
engineering design standards.
ÎThe piping and the temporary installation were subject 
to vibration caused by the pump.
ÎThe pressure gauge installed at the end of the tubing 
acted as a pendulum. Tubing does not have adequate mechanical strength to withst and vibration and to support 
instrumentation, such as the pressure transmitter.
ÎAfter the cause of the plugging filters on the suction 
pipe of the pump was eliminated, the temporary installation and the pressure transmitter were not needed, but were never removed.
ÎAs a “temporary” installation, the pressure gauge may 
not have received attention, inspection, and maintenance, particularly after it was no longer needed. It may just have been forgotten!

Why did it happen?
ÎPoor housekeeping contributed to this incident for 
two reasons:
- The initial fire started in a fiber drum being 
improperly used for trash and debris from 
construction and maintenance. The drum was not 
emptied regularly.
- The fire grew much larger because of 
accumulated polymer on piping, equipment, and the 
building structure. This accumulated combustible 
solid material was the fuel which made the fire much 
worse.
ÎThe accumulated polymer came from leaks of an 
aqueous polymer emulsion due to process equipment 
problems. 
ÎThe operating personnel in the plant gave up on 
trying to keep the plant clean because the repeated 
leaks made this a hopeless task.
ÎThe leakage of polymer was an equipment design 
issue beyond the control of operating personnel. This 
was an engineering design problem which needed 
management and engineering attention.
ÎPerhaps the culture in which a dirty plant had become 
“normal” was a factor in making it acceptable to put 
trash and maintenance debris in a fiber drum and to 
not empty the trash drum regularly.
ÎThis kind of situation is called “normalization of 
deviation” when discussing process safety culture. 
This is just a fancy term for giving up on changing an 
unacceptable situation and accepting it as normal.

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - January 2013 [2013-01-Beacon-English]","First of all, thank you to everybody who participated in the 
November 2012 “Find the Problem” contest. We thank you for 
your interest, and, for those of you who also participated in the survey, for your valuable fee dback on the Beacon. This Beacon 
needed to be prepared for publica tion and translation before all of 
the contest entries were submitted, so we were not able to include 
additional problems and hazards that have been undoubtedly identified by our tens of thousands of readers. Be assured that we 
were quite liberal in determining “correct” answers and accepted many other real problems beyond the ones listed here. Here are some of the issues we identified:
1. This is an easy one! Piping support is extremely poor!2. The pressure between the rupture disk and the relief valve 
compromises the integrity of the emergency pressure relief system. Rupture disks burst wh en the difference between the 
upstream pressure and the downstream pressure exceeds the rupture pressure. If there is pressure downstream of the disk, it will not burst at the intended process pressure.
3. Despite the warning sign, the plug in the bonnet of this 
bellows sealed safety valve (which protects the valve during shipping) has not been removed. This will affect the pressure at which the valve opens.
4. Flexible hoses are being used to connect piping which does 
not fit together properly. Also, the flange on the right appears to be missing at least one bolt and the faces of the flange do not align properly.
5. All of these pumps are identical in appearance and there is no 
evidence of any labeling.
6. The valves and other pipe f ittings on the inlet of the relief 
valve (RV) result in greater inlet pressure drop, which could cause relief valve chattering. Th e block valve on the RV inlet 
does not appear to have anything to prevent closing it and isolating the RV from the process.
7. There are many hazards in this photograph. Here are some of 
them, (you may find others!):  (1) no visible label on the storage tank; (2) no eye wash or safety shower in the area; (3) the person in the picture is not wearing any personal protective equipment; (4) no chocks at tank truck wheels; (5) no visible spill containment; (6) many tripping hazards (and slipping hazards from the snow); (7) little or nothing to prevent backing the truck into the shed and unloading piping; (8) inadequate platform to access the unloading connection; (9) no way to drain the hose when unloading is complete; (10) no pressure gages anyw here on the unloading piping; 
(11) the valve handle downstream of the pump is too high; (12) the unloading pipi ng is poorly supported.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - February 2013 [2013-02-Beacon-English]","You will recognize Picture 1 from the November 2012 and 
January 2013 issues of the Beacon . It is an obvious example of badly 
supported piping. But sometimes problems with inadequate support 
of piping and other equipment are not so easy to see.
Picture 2 – The steel supporting the pipes has bent, possibly 
because the weight of the pipes is more than the steel can support. 
Perhaps this was a result of a change – was a second pipe added 
without considering the design of the supporting steel?
Picture  3 – The pipe has moved horizontally and the pipe support 
stand has moved out of the support shoe.
Picture 4 – Look closely – the steel supports are not touching the 
ground. They are hanging from the pipes rather than supporting them!
Picture 5 – Somebody has cut out a section of the structural steel to 
make room for a valve!
Pipes and equipment which are not properly supported will be 
subject to stress, vibration, or other problems. This can cause leaks, 
or even a complete collapse of piping or equipment. 
As you work in your plant, look for problems with poorly 
supported equipment, excessive vibration, or other issues. A good 
general rule - if it doesn't look like it did on the day it was installed, there might be a problem! Report problems to your management, and 
follow up to make sure the problems are corrected.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - April 2013 [2013-04-Beacon-English]","inlet pressure drop, excessive back pressure, an oversized relief valve, and a relief valve which must handle widely varying 
flow rates. We will explain the first of these in more detail.
Look at the picture above on the right. Under normal process c onditions the vessel pressure is below the set pressure of 
the relief valve, and the pressure at the relief valve is th e same as the vessel pressure (a).  If a process upset increases the  
vessel pressure, the pressure at the relie f valve increases by the same amount, and if the pressure exceeds the relief valve 
set pressure the valve opens (b). As soon as the valve opens, flow  begins through the pipe to the relief valve, and the flow 
results in a pressure drop between the vessel and the valve. If this pressure drop is large enough, the pressure at the relief 
valve can be low enough that the relief valv e closes (c). The flow stops, the pressure  at the relief valve increases back to 
the vessel pressure because there is no fl ow to cause pressure drop, and the relief valve opens again (d)! This happens over 
and over, and can be very rapid, cau sing vibration and damage to the re lief valve, pipes, and equipment. In the November 2012 Beacon many readers 
correctly identified one safety issue with the relief valve in the picture at left – potentially closing a block valve, isolating the relief valve so it cannot provide protection against excess pressure. A second possible problem, a piping system which may cause the relief valve to chatter, was not identified by nearly as many people.
What is “chattering”?
Chattering is the rapid opening and closing of a 
pressure relief valve. The resulting vibration may cause misalignment, valve seat damage and, if prolonged, can cause mechanical failure of valve internals and associated piping.

The left photograph and diagram

The photograph and diagram on the 
right show a different kind of pressure relief valve – a balanced bellows pressure relief valve. This valve has a bellows between the process and the valve bonnet. The bellows (when the bonnet is vented to atmosphere) prevents back pressure from assisting the spring in keeping the relief valve closed, and also protects the spring from corrosion. Note that it may be difficult to tell what kind of relief valve is installed from the external appearance of the relief valve.
A balanced bellows relief valve may 
be used when the relief valve discharges to a collection header instead of directly to the atmosphere. In a conventional relief valve, the bonnet pressure is equal to the downstream pressure, while in a properly vented balanced bellows relief valve the bonnet pressure is atmospheric pressure.  For the valve to function as designed, the bonnet of a balanced bellows relief valve must be vented to atmospheric pressure - the vent  must not be plugged. It must also vent to a safe place. Note that, in spite of a warning sign, there is a plug in the vent of the balanced bellows relief valve in the picture at top right (red arrow).http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

ÎIf you try to operate a pneumatic or electric valve (open or  close it), and it will not operate, stop and think. Perhaps 
there is a good reason why the valve will not operate. For example:
• Maybe you are trying to operate the wrong valve!
• The valve may be prevented from operating because of a safety interlock.
• The valve may be locked out or de-energized because of some kind of maintenance work or other activity 
that requires equipment isolation or lockout.
ÎNever force a valve to operate directly by connecting the act uator to air or another type of power supply if the valve 
will not operate by its normal control system.
ÎIf a valve will not open, and it has a bypass around it, do not  use the bypass to establish flow until you understand why 
the valve won’t open.
ÎContact your management and engineers and get help in inv estigating the reason that you are not able to operate the 
valve. Do not take any action until everybody  understands why the valve will not operate.

had been cleaned. However the operator went to the wrong r eactor – a reactor which was in the reaction stage. The 
reaction mixture, at an estimated pressure of 70 psig, contai ned flammable vinyl chloride. The operator was not able to 
open the pneumatic valve on the bottom of the reactor – there  was a safety interlock which prevented opening the valve 
while the reactor was under pressure. It is believed that the ope rator connected a nearby air supply to the valve and forced 
it to open, releasing reaction mixture into the building.  Flammable vapors from the released material ignited."

This month marks the 25thanniversary of the Piper Alpha 
offshore oil platform disaster in the North Sea approximately 110 miles (180 km) from Aberdeen Scotland. On July 6, 1988, a series of catastrophic explosions and fires destroyed the platform. Of the 226 people on the platform at the time of the event, 165 died along with two emergency response personnel during a rescue attempt. The platform was totally destroyed.
Investigation was hindered by a lack of physical evidence. 
Based upon eyewitness accounts it was concluded that a release of light hydrocarbon occurred when a pump was restarted after having been prepared for maintenance.  Unknown to the workers starting 
the pump, a relief valve in the pump discharge had been removed for maintenance. A blank had been loosely installed in place of the relief valve at a location which was not readily visible from the pump vicinity. When the pump was started this blank leaked, producing a flammable cloud, which subsequently found an ignition source. The pump was started at about 10 PM, and by 1 AM, three hours later, the platform had been entirely destroyed and most of its occupants had been killed.
As would be expected in a disaster of this magnitude, the 
investigation identified many root causes related to design, operation, safety culture, emergency response, and training. We highlight two issues below which are particularly relevant to you as a plant worker.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

was made of the relief valve work. The relief valve work was al so not mentioned in the control room or maintenance logs. 
Continuing problems with the adequacy of turnovers a nd log entries were a problem known to some workers.
Be complete in documenting the status of all equipment in  your plant logs. At the end of your shift, clearly 
communicate the information to the incoming workers. Take the time to  make sure they fully understand the 
status of all operating equipment, and the status of all maintenance jobs.
ÎWork Permit System.  The work permit system was not consistently implemented according to procedure. For 
example, omission of important information such as si gnatures and gas test results was common. Operations 
representatives often did not inspect the job site before suspe nding the permit at the end of the shift or when closing the 
permit indicating the work had been completed. Craft supervisor s often left permits on the control room desk at the end of 
a shift rather than personally returning them to the res ponsible operations representativ e as required by the procedure.
Always follow work permit pr ocedures exactly as required, including all documentation, communication, and 
record keeping. Do not take short cuts, and be sure to personally check everything on  the permit. Never assume 
that things have been done correctly – if you a re going to sign the permit, check it yourself .

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - August 2013 [2013-08-Beacon-English]","ÎBefore starting any pump, check that all valves are in 
the correct position. Be sure that the valves in the intended flow path are open,  and other valves, such as 
drains and vents, are closed.
ÎIf you are starting a pump from a remote location such 
as a control room, be sure that the pump is ready for operation. If you are not sure, go to the pump and check it, or have somebody else check it.
ÎMake sure that key steps important for safe operation 
of pumps, including all valve positions, are included in your plant operating procedures and checklists.
See the October 2002 Process Safety Beacon for a similar incident.What can you do?
The answer must be “yes” or we wouldn’t have a subject for this Beacon ! The centrifugal pumps in the pictures are 
all water pumps which exploded. The expl osions did not occur because of any contamination or chemical reaction with 
something that was not supposed to be in the pump. In fact , explosions like this have ha ppened with very pure water –
boiler feed water pumps, condensate pumps, and deionized water pumps.
How did these explosions happen? The pum ps were operated for some period of  time with both the pump suction and 
discharge valves closed. Because water could not flow through the pump, all of the energy which normally goes into  
pumping is instead converted to heat.  When water is heated , it expands generating hydrosta tic pressure inside the pump. 
This may be enough pressure to cause the pump to fail – perha ps the seal would fail, or the pump casing might rupture. 
These explosions may cause significant damage or injuries because of the built-up energy. However, if the water 
exceeds its boiling point before the pump fails, a more energe tic explosion may occur because the released superheated 
water will rapidly boil and expand (a boiling liquid expanding vapor  explosion - BLEVE). The severity and damage will 
be similar to a steam boiler explosion.
This type of explosion can happen with any fluid if a pum p is operated with suction and discharge valves closed. If a 
non-hazardous fluid like water can result in the damage shown in the pictures, think how much more severe the damage 
might be if the fluid is flammable - the released material c ould catch fire. If the fluid is toxic or corrosive, people near 
the pump could be severely injured by the released material.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

Air is always all around us, and the oxygen it 
contains is necessary for life. But, compressed air
(or any other compressed gas) contains a lot of 
energy and can cause major damage in case of a vessel or pipe failure. The pictures show the consequences of three explosions resulting from failure during pneumatic pressure testing of pipes and vessels.1. A flange failed while pressure testing a 36 
inch (~1 meter) diameter pipe at about 1,800 psig (12.41 MPa, or ~125 bar) compressed air pressure. One person was killed, 15 injured, and there was significant damage to the equipment.
2. Pipes connected to a tank were pressure tested 
using compressed air. The tank was isolated 
from the pipes by closing valves, and there was no blind or other positive isolation. A valve leaked allowing air to pressurize the tank. It took off like a rocket and landed on top of the process rack! (See the October 2007 Beacon )
3. In this incident, the compressed gas was 
nitrogen (not air), but th e consequences of the 
explosion are similar. A pipeline failed during the compressed nitrogen pressure test, killing one worker and seriously injuring three others.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

Monument to the victims of the 
Senghenydd disasterThe Senghenydd explosion was one of the even ts that led to a recognition of the 
potential hazard of sparks from electrical equipment igniting a flammable vapor, dust, or mist cloud. One protective approach is the use of “intrinsically safe equipment.” This  is defined as “equipment and wiring which is incapable of releasing sufficient electrical or thermal energy under normal or abnormal c onditions to cause ignition of a specific 
hazardous atmospheric mixture in its most easily ignited concentration.” This is accomplished by specific design of the electrical equipment - for example by limiting the amount of power available to electrical equipment in a hazardous area to a level below that which will ignite the fuel mixture.
While a thorough discussion of electrical  safety in a hazardous area is beyond the 
scope of the Beacon , there are some important things (see below) that you, as a plant 
operator or maintenance worker, can do to maintain the integrity of electrical equipment in areas which are classified as hazardous. 
ÎBe careful when bringing any electric equipment into 
a hazardous area, either yourself or when authorizing permits to work. Some examples:   anything with an electric motor such as a portable pump, portable instruments, flashlights, communications devices, motor vehicles (including fork trucks, lift trucks, etc.). Ask about anything that must be plugged in or which needs a battery! Be certain that all equipment is acceptable for use in the specific hazardous area where you intend to use it. If you are not sure, get help from an expert who knows!
ÎMake sure that electrical safety in hazardous areas is 
addressed in Management of Change (MOC) reviews. "

What happened?
A worker was asked to move two open top 5-gallon pails containing aqueous 
sodium permanganate solution from one lo cation to another. When he picked up 
the pails, the contents of one of them  erupted, spraying the worker with the 
solution. Sodium permanganate is a strong oxidizer, and the splashed material set the worker’s clothing on fire. His injuries required hospital treatment.
The facility where the incident occurred  handled both oxidizing agents (such as 
sodium permanganate) and reducing materials (for example, sodium thiosulfate and sodium metabisulfite) in small quantities, sometimes in pails or other small containers. At times, materials were transpor ted in pails which were not labeled. It 
is believed that the pail which erupted contained one of the reducing agents 
handled at the facility, and sodium perma nganate solution was added to the pail. 
The reaction apparently was delayed because  the materials were not mixed and the 
solid reducing material already in the pail may have formed a protective layer of relatively non-reactive material on its surface . When the worker lifted the pail, the 
material was disturbed and reacted rapidly,  ejecting material from the pail.     http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

ÎOxidizing materials such as sodium permanganate are highly reactive with 
many materials. Some oxidizing materials are reactive enough that they can ignite organic materials (for example, clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, and many chemicals) on contact and cause a fire.
ÎOxidizing materials are particularly reactive with another type of chemical 
called a “reducing agent”, such as sodium thiosulfate or sodium metabisulfite. The reaction generates a lot of heat and can cause the reaction mixture to boil.
ÎThe material safety data sheet (MSDS) for a chemical will tell you if it is a

Take care of the insulation in your plant to prevent corrosion!ÎLiterature suggests that CUI may be a concern for equipment se rvice temperatures between minus  4 and 175 deg. C (25 to 350 F).
ÎSome common contributors to CUI include:
¾Water in the insulation, either because of improper storage befo re installation, improper installa tion, or damage after install ation. 
This may be compounded if there is corrosive chemical contamina tion of water soaked into the insulation – for example, acids 
and other process chemicals, or chlo rides such as salt from the air near salt water or from de-icing chemicals.
¾Water or other fluids can flow through certa in types of insulation and move away from the source of the leak. CUI may occur in 
areas farther from the leak than e xpected –especially in low spots.
¾Pinholes or small process leaks from gaskets and fittings underneat h insulation, which may remain undetected until the damage 
causes a larger leak.•A 4-inch (10 cm)  pipe containing liquid ammonia leaked 
because of extensive corrosion. Th e quality of the pipe insulation 
was poor allowing water to soak into the insulation. The piping system had been partially inspected during the previous turnaround, but this particular s ection of pipe was not examined.
•A 1-inch (2.5 cm) flammable gas feed line ruptured because of 
wall thinning of the pipe due to corrosion under the insulation, causing a gas fire. The pipe which failed was a bypass which was not actually in operation at the time. Because there was no flow through the line, it was cooler, about 80 degrees C (175 F), than the main process pipe. The temperature was low enough that steam or moisture in the air could condense, and liquid water 
which contacted the insulated pipe did not evaporate quickly. This,  in combination with damaged insulation, created conditions which make corrosion more likely.

The short answer to this questi ons is YES!! In 1993, Dr. Trevor 
Kletz, who passed away on October 31, 2013 at the age of 91, wrote a 
book titled “Lessons from Disaster: How Organizations Have No Memory and Accidents Recur.” Twenty years later, this still happens.
A recent article described an inci dent at a gasoline processing plant 
in Norway. A carbon adsorber used  for emission control ignited a 
flammable atmosphere in the attached tank. Sadly, a very similar incident occurred at a bulk chemical storage terminal in Savannah, Georgia, USA in 1995. A thorough literature search would undoubtedly find more similar incidents.
What happened? In both incidents, a carbon adsorber was used to 
reduce emission of pollutants from the storage tank. Both facilities failed to recognize that adsorbing  hydrocarbon vapors generated heat in the carbon bed. This heat provided the ignition source for the flammable vapor in the tank vapor space. 
Why did it occur?  Two  design problems were present in both 
systems, even though they happened 12 years apart and in different parts of the world!  The systems did not account for the heat generation from adsorption and did not provide a flame arrester between the tank 
and carbon adsorber

ÎActively participate in all of your plant’s 
safety activities and encourage your co-workers to participate as well.A Beacon reader recently sent an incident description and thought 
it might make a good Beacon topic. In a facility, there was a safety rule prohibiting wearing jewelry. One worker continued to wear a ring on his finger. As he got out  of a truck, the ring caught on 
something and his little finger was amputated. 
While the injury was serious and will impact the worker for the 
rest of his life, the incident is not a typical Beacon topic because it was not process related. However, this incident reminds us that we must pay attention to all aspects of safety, including process safety and occupational safety. People fall from heights, fall down steps, cut themselves with sharp objects, are hit by falling objects, and many other types of incidents that have nothing to do with the process technology in the facility. These people are hurt and affected just as much as those injured in process related incidents.
While the Beacon focuses on process related incidents, never 
forget that occupational safety is also important. For a safe workplace, we need to have effective programs for both process and occupational safety.
The picture is particularly appropriate to the incident described 
above. Harold Lloyd performed most of the stunts in this classic film himself, despite losing a thumb and part of a finger in an accident while filming a movie four years earlier!

silent film comedy classic “Safety Last”
ÎOccupational safety focuses on accident prevention through 
work systems aimed at minimizing risk of personal injury.
ÎProcess safety focuses on prevention and mitigation of fires, 
explosions, hazardous material releases, and other potentially large incidents associated with the chemistry and physics of the manufacturing process.
ÎProcess safety incidents have the potential to be very large and 
affect many people, as well as the environment and property. A large process safety incident can impact the community outside your plant. 
ÎSome incidents have both occupational and process safety 
characteristics. For example, opening a pipe containing a hot flammable material can injure th e pipefitter doing the work, from 
exposure to the material. It can also result in a fire or explosion.

found that “BP primarily used injury rates to measure process safety performance at its U.S. refineries before the Texas City accident. Although BP was not alone in this practice, BP’s reliance on injury rates significantly hindered its perception of process risk.”
The panel concluded that the BP process safety management 
system did not effectively measure process safety performance. Other companies recognized that they had a similar problem. CCPS and other government, industry, a nd professional organizations have 
developed new measures for process safety performance. While the details are beyond the scope of the Beacon, these measures focus on 
loss of containment of material and energy, and on the effectiveness of specific process safety manageme nt activities. For example, the 
American Petroleum Institute (API) developed RP 754 “Process Safety Performance Indicators for the Refining and Petrochemical 
Industries.” Industry organizations and individual companies all over the world are developing and using similar measures

The Problem
ÎTraditional injury rate statistics do not effectively measure 
how well your process safety management system is performing. Think about it – what if there is a large release of a flammable material, perhaps several tons, and it catches fire? If nobody is in the area, there will be no injuries. It may be reportable as an environmental release or a financial loss, but the incident will have no impact on your plant’s injury rate statistics! Yet, we can all agree that this is a significant pr ocess safety incident and we need 
to monitor the occurrence of events such as this.
ÎBecause common elements such as safety culture and 
operational discipline affect both process safety and occupational safety performance, you should be concerned about how well your 
process safety program is performing if your injury rate starts to increase. But do not make the mistake of believing that a low injury rate proves that your process safety program is effective!

Process safety is also about protecting the environment!ÎKnow what you are expected to do if you observe any 
material leaking from pipes or vessels in your plant. Understand what immediate ac tion you should take, who to 
report the leak to, and how to activate spill and leak response procedures for your plant.
ÎCheck your plant emergency response procedures and 
make sure they include required actions to prevent the release of hazardous material into rivers or other waterways in case of a fire, explosion, or other incident.
ÎInspect containment dikes and spill containment pads 
around pumps, loading and unloading areas, and other places where spills might be more likely. Make sure they are properly maintained and in good condition.
ÎPump rain water out of containment dikes around storage 
tanks promptly. If the dike is already full of water, it won’t be able to contain a spill!
ÎParticipate in emergency response drills and know what 
actions you need to take to prevent spilled hazardous material from escaping from your plant.November 1986 - A fire in an agricultural chemical warehouse 
in Basel, Switzerland, released tons of pollutants into the Rhine River. The pollution traveled th e length of the Rhine through 
four countries and caused serious environmental damage.
November 2005 - A plant explosion in Jilin, China, resulted in 
the release of 100 tons of benzene into the Songhua River creating a slick extending 80 kilometers downstream. The city of Harbin had to shut off the water supply for almost 4 million 
people for 5 days.

Some Incidents
ÎWe may think of process safety incidents as fires, 
explosions, and immediate injuries from exposure to toxic, corrosive, or otherwise hazardous materials. However, major spills of hazardous materials, especially into rivers or other bodies of water, are also process safety incidents. They have the potential to impact large numbers of people, including people far away from your plant.
ÎSome of the incidents listed above occurred 
because of a leak from a pipe, vessel, or containment pond, while others were a consequence of another 
process safety incident (a fire or explosion).
ÎFor spills or leaks, properly designed and 
maintained dikes around storage tanks and other process vessels, and containment pads in areas where spills might be more likely (for example, loading and unloading areas), are important protection systems to contain hazardous material spills. (1) A damaged storage tank and 
a spill into a containment dike; (2) Spill containment and cleanup efforts; (3) Aerial view of the Kingston spill; (4) The plant where the Charleston WV

Review all changes – even those intended for safety!ÎAny change to a system, including the addition 
of a new safety device, is a change that must be reviewed using your plant’s Management of Change (MOC) procedure.ÎWhen doing an MOC review of a new safety 
device, be sure to consider the possibility that the change introduces new hazards.ÎAfter the change is revi ewed, make sure it is 
implemented correctly and is ready for operation using your plant’s pre-startup safety review (PSSR) process. ÎGet emergency response personnel involved in 
MOC and PSSR if the ch ange impacts them.Picture 1 shows a fire hydrant in a town in the northern 
USA that gets a lot of snow in  the winter. The vertical steel 
rod fastened to the left side of the hydrant is intended to mark the location of the hydrant, as shown in Picture 2. A flag is installed at the top of the rod so firefighters can find the hydrant if it is covered with snow. The flag also marks the location of the hydrant so it is less likely to be damaged by snow removal equipment, and so people do not park vehicles where they will bl ock access to the hydrant. The 
flag is a safety device to  help people know where the 
hydrant is located if it is buried in snow.
Clearly this safety device has created a problem. The 
metal rod was installed so th at it passes through the valve 
handle. You cannot open the valve without first removing the rod! The rod may also impede the use of a hydrant 
wrench to open the hydrant. Wh ile the rod and flag can be 
removed, this will take valu able time, po ssibly in an 
emergency situation.

ÎThe flag on the fire hydrant can be considered to be 
a safety device – to protect the hydrant from damage by 
snow removal equipment, to remind people not to block access to the hydrant, and to help firefighters find the hydrant if it is buried by snow. But, because it was improperly installed, it is di fficult to quickly open the 
hydrant valve. So, a safety device has created a new, and perhaps more serious, safety problem!ÎAny safety device can create a new hazard. Any

Know when to stop – and when to get help!Persistence is admirable, but know when to stop and get help, and 
what limits cannot be exceeded. 
•When you have difficulties during operation or maintenance, 
don’t try to force your way through the problems. Stop and get 
help, ask if you should continue, and be willing to shut down if you don’t understand what is happening.
•Review startup and re-commissioning plans for potential failures, 
and plan what you can do to prevent or mitigate problems.
•Make sure instruments are accurate, and use the information they 
provide to make decisions. If an instrument reading does not seem right, don’t assume it is a faulty instrument! Think about 
what it could mean if the instrument is correct, and ask if the 
activity should continue.
•Know when to evacuate the area when your process is out of 
control, or if there is a leak of hazardous material.
•If you do not have criteria for when to switch from normal to 
emergency operating procedures or evacuation, ask leadership in 
your area for guidance.In some process safety incidents, operating personnel have failed to 
recognize that a process was not responding as expected. They attempted to keep a process  in operation by deviating from standard procedures, or put themselves in danger by attempting to correct an out of control process condition rather than evacuating. Some examples:•April 1995 Lodi, New Jersey blender explosion , 5 fatalities: The plant 
was blending water reactive chemicals. The operation continued 24 times longer than expected, with unexpected  heat and gas generation. Workers 
were trying to empty the blender when it exploded.
•April 2004 Illiopolis, Illinois polyvinylchloride plant explosion , 5 
fatalities [Picture 1]: A valve on a pressurized reactor was inadvertently opened generating a flammable vapor cloud in a building. Operators remained in the building trying to stop the release, and the vapor ignited.
•March 2005 Texas City, Texas refinery explosion , 15 fatalities [Picture 
2], and December 2005 Buncefield, England oil storage terminal 
explosion , 43 injuries and major damage [Picture 3]: Operators continued 
to fill vessels even though level instruments showed no increase, eventually resulting in a flammable material release which ignited.
•January 2010 Charleston, West Virginia phosgene release , 1 fatality: A 
process problem reduced the flow of phosgene from a cylinder. The feed was switched between cylinders to keep the process running. Standard procedures to clear phosgene from feed hoses were not followed. A liquid filled hose failed and released phosgene because of pressure from thermal expansion of the liquid and a faulty hose, exposing a worker to phosgene.

Many things contributed to the incidents above. 
However, there are lessons from them which can 
help you prevent injuries and fatalities in your plant:
•A process did not respond as expected from a 
known change. Nobody recognized the problem or asked for help about what was happening. For 
example, when filling a vessel, you expect the 
level to increase and should investigate what is 
happening if you do not get the correct response.
•Operators used non-standard procedures to 
attempt to keep a process in operation without 
recognizing the hazards involved.
•People tried to take heroic measures to remove 
reactive materials from a process vessel which 
exceeded safe operating limits, or to stop a leak from a process. Workers put themselves in 
danger while trying to correct a problem.

If you are asked to participate in an HIRA/PHA study, here are some things you can do to help make it better:
ÎShare your knowledge of how the steps in  a procedure are actually executed, especially if this is different from 
what is written. Explain the reasons to the HIRA/PHA te am so they can resolve them and make the actual and 
written procedures the same. 
ÎBefore the HIRA/PHA, talk to your colleagues about wh at you will be doing. Ask them to tell you about any 
issues that they want to be sure the team discusses.
ÎShare your years of operating experience, and that of your co-workers, about the reliability of equipment, 
instrumentation, and alarms or safety systems. Make sure  the team knows what works, what doesn’t work well, and 
what has gone wrong in the past.
ÎVerify that any operator action – for example, action in response to an alarm – which the team considers a 
safeguard, is understood by operators, and can be done reliably in the time required to keep the process safe.
ÎDon't be shy! Proactively share your knowledge and experience, and don't wait for somebody to ask.
ÎRemember that your role is both to learn and to teach.  You can learn from the other experts in the HIRA/PHA,

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - November 2014 [2014-11-Beacon-English]","At about 5:30 AM on November 19, 1984 there was a 
major fire and a series of explosions at a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage and distribution terminal at San Juan 
Ixhuatepec, Mexico City, Mexico. There were approximately 
600 fatalities, approximately 7,000 injuries, 200,000 people 
were evacuated, and the terminal was destroyed. The blasts 
were recorded on a seismometer 20 km (12.4 miles) away, and the largest blast registered 0.5 on the Richter scale. Most 
of the injuries and fatalities were in the surrounding 
community – people were living as close as 130 m (425 ft.) 
from the terminal.
The cause of the accident could not be definitively 
established because of the destruction of the facilities and 
absence of witness reports. It is believed that LPG leaked 
from a tank or pipeline into a walled enclosure. LPG vapors 
formed a flammable vapor cloud about 2 m (6.6 ft.) high. 
The cloud was ignited, possibly by a ground flare.
There is evidence that some storage tanks in the facility 
may have been overfilled, leading to diversion of LPG flow 
to ground flares. The initiating release may have come from 
overfilling a tank or overpressure of one of the storage tanks.
Many causes contributed to the disaster, including the 
design of the terminal ( for example, inadequate spacing of 
tanks, ineffective gas detection, lack of passive fire 
protection systems), destruction of the fire fighting system by 
the explosions, improper maintenance of safety equipment, 
and a large number of people living close to the terminal.

There were thousands of fatalities, hundreds of thousands of injuries, as well as long term health, environmental, and economic impacts. This incident is widely considered to be the worst industrial disaster in history.
It is believed that water entered MIC storage 
tank E610 (1). An exothermic reaction resulted, generating heat and pressure which opened the tank relief valve. Some critical instruments in the field and control room (2) were not working properly. A refrigeration system (3) was out of service and the refrigerant had been removed. Gas from the relief valve flowed to a caustic scrubber (4) which was shut down for maintenance. From there, the gas flowed to a flare (5) which was also shut down awaiting replacement of corroded piping. The toxic gas was released to the atmosphere without treatment exposing hundreds of thousands of people.

Everybody in your organization, including executives, plant management, engineers and technical 
personnel, unit management, supervisor s and foremen, operators, maintena nce workers, and even office and 
service workers, should be able to answer the questions  below. Obviously the answers will vary considerably 
depending on the person’s job respons ibility, but everybody must understand his or her ro le in preventing a 
major tragedy like the Bhopal disaster.
What is the worst thing that can happen where I work and in my job?
What are the systems in place to keep that from happening (preventive systems)?
How do I know that these preventive systems are adequate and working properly?
What are the systems in place to respond to th at event if it does happen (mitigative systems)?
How do I know that these mitigative syste ms are adequate and working properly?
Are any of the preventive and mitigative systems bypassed or shut down as they were at Bhopal?
What is my role in making sure that these preven tive and mitigative systems  are functioning properly?
There were many failures in design, management, safety culture, and operation 
of the facility which contributed to the tragedy. You can find many good resources on the Internet which describe the incident  in great detail. Take some time this 
month to learn about the incident, and what it means to you in your job.Note:  All pictures taken in December

Understand all process risks in your plan t and your role in managing them!The November and December 2014 issues of the Process Safety Beacon marked the 30th
anniversary of two of the worst industrial disast ers in history – the November 1984 explosions and 
fires at an LPG terminal in San Juan Ixhuatep ec, Mexico City, Mexico (1) and the December 1984 
toxic gas release in Bhopal, India (2). Thes e incidents were catastrophes impacting tens of 
thousands of people. The “What can you do?” sections of these Beacons encouraged you to 
understand the worst thing that might possibly happe n in your plant, and your role in making sure 
that event does not happen.
However, you should also be aware that the worst process incident that can happen in your plant 
may not be the same as the highest process risk.  Ri sk is a combination of  how likely an incident is, 
and how bad the consequences could be (3).  Th e process incident in your plant with the worst 
consequences may be very unlikely to occur. Ot her less severe incidents may be more likely, 
making the risk of these events higher than the incident with the worst consequences.. You should 
be aware of all process risks in your plant, and your role in managing all of those process risks.

In a number of serious events, there may have been more people in the area
than were needed to door monitor the job. Some examples:
•Nineteen people managed to escape, although some were engulfed in flames,
when investigating a leaking oil pipe in a refinery. The leak suddenly
increased in size releasing a flammable vapor cloud which ignited (1).
•There were 17 fatalities from an explosion when a compressor removing
vapors from a wastewater storage tank was restarted. The tank unexpectedly
contained a flammable atmosphere (2).
•Three of five workers investigating a pipe leak in a metal processing plant
were fatally injured when a hydrogen fire broke out (3).
Therisk of a serious event is higher when equipment is starting up, shutting
down,or in abnormal operation. Why? In some cases, safeguards may not be
fullyfunctional during a transition. During startup, it is possible that somebody
made a mistake in preparing the equipment for startup and something is not
correct. Perhaps a valve that should be closed has been left open, a blind has
been left in a line, or some other error. People doing the startup are focused on
the task at hand and may not be thinking about what could go wrong or what
happens if it does. Upset conditions may create a large number of alarms which
hidea potential problem .
Toomany people in the area, whether the control room or the plant,can be a
distraction, causing bad decisions which could lead to serious process safety
events. They may also be injured by the event, and there was no good reason for
them to be in the area.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Publications/Beacon/index.aspx

Reviewoperating procedures for non-standard operating modes –for example, startup , shutdown, process upset,
investigating a process or equipment problem. The procedures should consider who is allowed in the area and who isn’t.
If this information is not clear,bring it to the attention of plant management. Here are some questions that the operating
procedure should have answers for :
1.Whois essential to this task? Who MUST be there? Who arejust concerned people whodo not need to be in the
area and who should be directed to go to a safer location? For planned activities such as startup and shutdown, this
shouldbe determined when the startup or shutdown plan isdeveloped.
2.Ifsomething goes wrong, what could happen topeople in thearea?
3.Review emergency procedures for leaks –do they consider what people who are not essential for response should
do while the leak is being investigated?
4.Do all people in thearea know what they should do if a loss of containment occurs?Arethey using the proper
personal protective equipment?
5.Consider postponing tasks to preventnon-essentialpeople from being in an area during non -standard operating
modes.
6.Ifyou don’t have a specific, defined job to do in the operation , maybe you should go somewhere else !If you are not
sure, askfor permission from the area supervisor or operator to bepresentwhile this operation is taking place .www.acutech -consulting.com

Pay attention to details in your job –they are important!There was an exothermic reaction in a drum of radioactive waste
material in a nuclear waste repository. The drum ruptured, releasing
smallamountsof radiation , exposing other waste drums to elevated
temperature, and contaminating 20 workers with low levels of
radiation. Other drums containing similar waste material may also be
in danger of rupture. The facility had to be shut down and the
recovery cost is expected to be several hundred million dollars.
A chemical reaction occurred in the drum, which contained acidic
waste material and oxidizing chemicals including nitrate salts, as
well as an organic absorbent. This mixture can react to generate heat
and pressure.
While a final determination of causes has not been made,
newspaper reports indicate that a typographical error in a revision to
a facility policy may have resulted in the use of the wrong
absorbent! The revised policy specifically stated that an organic
absorbent should be used, when it should have specified the use of
aninorganic absorbent (a clay based absorbent). The error was not
recognized and the absorbent was changed, resulting in the incident.
Details matter! Those two letters, “i” and “n,” make a huge
difference in the characteristics of the absorbent!

Small diameter tubing connecting a pressure gauge to process piping
ruptured releasing flammable material which ignited. The resulting fire
destroyed a plant (October 2012 Beacon). The detail –a few inches of
small tubing in thousands of feet of pipe!
An ungrounded instrument probe in a duct built up a static electric charge.
The duct was air conveying a combustible solid powder. A spark ignited a
dust explosion. The detail –a single ungrounded conductive piece of
equipment out of thousands of components that were properly grounded!
There was a significant fire on an offshore oil platform when a small hose
failed releasing methanol, which ignited. The hose was leaking and had
been repaired with duct tape (July 2007 Beacon)! The detail –a single
small hose leak on a platform containing large piping and equipment!
Many explosions have resulted from running a centrifugal pump with
both the suction and discharge valves closed, allowing temperature and

“Safe Work Practices” refers to the processes 
we use to authorize non-routine work activities, and to control the hazards and manage the risks associated with these activities.
Safe Work Practices often authorize work 
through permits, which often include checklists of potential hazards associated with the work.
A “non-routine activity” has nothing to do with 
how often the activity is done. Instead it refers to activities that are NOT part of the normal process for converting raw materials to finished product, and NOT COVERED by the plant’s standard operating procedures for normal operations.
Some examples of where Safe Work Practices 
are applied:  line breaking, vessel entry, other confined space entry, control of energy sources, lock out/tag out, hot work permits, elevated work permits, excavation in process areas.Did you know?
Understand all of the Safe Work Practices in your plant and 
your work area, including authorization and permit systems. Know what activities require a permit, and what the process is for obtaining a permit.
If you are authorizing non-routine work activities covered 
by your plant’s work permit systems, make sure you are properly trained, understand the permit systems, and understand the hazards associated with the work.
If you issue a permit, make sure the people doing the job 
understand all of the hazards.
Don’t rely on others to verify that a system is properly 
prepared for the work. If you are going to sign the permit, check everything yourself!
If you are doing the non-routine work activity, make sure 
that you have the required permit, follow all of the required procedures to control hazards, and use the proper personal protective equipment. If the job changes while in progress, contact the person authorizing the work for permission and to determine if any additional safety precautions are needed.

In August 2012, a pipe in a Crude  Distillation Unit (CDU) in a refinery 
in California ruptured, releasing hot, flammable hydrocarbon pr ocess fluid 
(Photo 1). The released materia l partially vaporized forming a large vapor 
cloud which ignited. The pipe failed due to thinning caused by sulfidation 
corrosion, a common damage mechanism in refineries. Sulfidation  
corrosion failures are of great concern because of a comparativ ely high 
likelihood of catastrophic failure. This can happen because cor rosion 
occurs at a relatively uniform rate over a broad area, so a pip e can get 
progressively thinner until it bursts, rather than a failure st arting as a small 
leak at a pit, crack, or local thin area.
In November 2013, a fire erupted after a leak from a pipe conta ining 
vacuum residue at a CDU in a refinery in Brazil (Photo 2). The leakage 
occurred due to the rupture of a straight section pipe in a pip e rack, near 
the pre-flash tower of the CDU. The investigation determined th at the 
pipe section was very thin (less than 1 mm). The specified mate rial for 
this pipe section was an alloy steel, but the actual material w as found to 
be carbon steel. This pipe section had been replaced during a m aintenance 
shutdown in 1998, and the wrong material of construction was us ed.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

Immediately report any leak that you discover, no matter how sm all, and follow up to make sure action is taken.  
If you are responding to what app ears to be a sma ll leak in a l arge pipe or vessel, consider the possibility that the 
“small” leak is actually caused by a large area of thin or weak  metal which could suddenly become a large leak. Plan 
your response to ensure that people are protected if this happe ns.
If you are replacing piping or other equipment, make sure that you use the correct material for all replacement parts. 
Follow the Positive Material Identification (PMI) procedures at  your facility and verify implementation in the field. 
Perform a 100 percent component i nspection of what has been rep laced during a turnaround before re-starting.
Frequent use of leak repair clamps to externally stop process f luid leaks raises questions about effectiveness of a 
mechanical integrity program. These devices are intended to pro vide a temporary repair while a process continues 
operating until a permanent repair can be made, perhaps during a plant shutdown. When such temporary repairs are 
implemented, follow you plant’s management of change procedures . Be sure that temporary repairs are managed so they 
can be included for permanent re pair when planning the next shu tdown.
Understand and make sure that recommendations from your inspect ion group are implemented in a timely manner.
An effective management of change (MOC) process is vital to the  success of any piping integrity management 
program. Your plant inspection group can anticipate changes in corrosion or other deteriora tion and change inspection 
schedules and procedures appropria tely. Make sure your inspecti on group is involved in the a pproval process for changes 
that may affect piping or other equipment integrity.

In both of these incidents, the Mechanical Integrity Management  System was not successful in detecting or 
replacing deteriorated piping components before failure. In the  2013 incident, the maintenance system did not 
ensure that the correct material of construction was used when the pipe was replaced. More effective 
mechanical integrity and maintenance programs could have preven ted both incidents.

Although these two incidents occurred in completely different t ypes of manufacturing plant,  they have one important 
thing in common. In both incidents, the process had exceeded sp ecified safe operating limits during operations before the 
incident. The abnormal conditions became accepted – this is call ed “normalization of deviation.” These warning signs 
were either not investigated, or  actions recommended by the inv estigation were not implemented. “Conduct of 
Operations” can be summarized in t wo simple concepts:  (1) Say what you intend to do (procedures), and (2) Always do 
what you say. This means, for example, that if your operating p rocedures say to shut down if a critical safety parameter 
exceeds a specified value, you must always take this action!
•Know what the critical safety process parameters are for your p lant, know the consequences of exceeding them, and 
know what to do if they are exceeded. 
•Always take the required actions if critical safety parameters are violated.
•If critical safety parameters are exceeded, report it to manage ment so an appropriate investigation can be done.

flammable chemicals from a 2000 US gallon batch reactor into a building in a specialty chemical plant in New Jersey. Operators were unable to cont rol the temperature of the 
batch, and the runaway reacti on partially vented through the 
reactor manway into the production building. 9 people were injured, 2 seriously, and chemicals were released into the surrounding community. It is believed that the initial temperature of the batch was higher than normal, making it more difficult for operators to control the batch temperature with the available cooling.
In 8 of the previous 32 batches produced, operators had 
difficulty in controlling the batch temperature. The temperature and the rate of temperature rise for individual steps of the process were beyond the limits specified by the 
procedure. In some cases, the temperature exceeded the maximum range of the reactor temperature recorder (150ºC

Alpha North Sea oil platform disaster (165 fatalities) in July 1988 (top 
photo, see July 2005 and 2013 Beacons) was a release of light hydrocarbon condensate when a pump was restarted. Unknown to wo rkers 
starting the pump, a relief valv e in the pump discharge had bee n removed 
for service and a blank had been  loosely installed in its place . This section 
of piping was not readily visible from near the pump.
One company recently reported (Forest, J.J., Process Safety Progress

containment (LOPC) incidents in the plants studied were related  to 
Conduct of Operation causes (see June 2015 Beacon ). Most of those were 
due to problems with properly setting up process equipment befo re

•Expectation not set by management
•Setup not formally included in operator training
•Lack of discipline and consiste nt format for operating procedur es and 
shift communications
•Failure to follow standard ope rating procedures for complex 
equipment setup

know where material and energy comes from, where it can go, and  how that will change w hen you change the 
equipment status.
•Complete a field assessment of a system before changing its sta tus. Make sure that all components of the system are 
properly installed, and that eve rything is in the correct posit ion (open, closed, on, off, etc.).
•Be particularly careful when putting equipment back into servic e following maintenance or any other activity where 
the equipment was taken apart. Make sure that it has been prope rly re-installed, that all temporary isolation devices 
such as blinds have been remove d, and that all valves are in th e right position. 
•Set a personal goal of zero equi pment setup errors and “walk th e line” incidents in your job, and encourage your 
colleagues to do so as well!

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - September 2015 [2015-09-Beacon-English]","A railroad tank car of methyl mer captan, a poisonous flammable gas (boiling point = 6 ºC), was being unloaded in an 
area where other railroad tank cars containing methyl mercaptan  and chlorine gas were sto red or unloaded. During 
unloading, a failure occurred in a threaded section of pipe whe re it entered a 2-inch to 1-in ch reducer attached to the tank 
car's unloading valve. A cloud of methyl mercaptan was released  and ignited shortly after emergency response personnel 
arrived, sending a fireball 200 f eet into the air and damaging unloading hoses on a chlorine rail car. Two workers were 
fatally exposed to toxic gases, a third fatality resulted from the effects of toxic gas expos ure and burns, and approximately
2000 people in the area were evacu ated. The entire contents of the methyl mercaptan railcar were released (nearly 150,000 
pounds), and approximately 26,000 pounds of chlorine were also released (Fig. 1). Although both railcars had excess flow 
valves on their unloading connections, the valves did not close  and stop the flow. The flow rate through the failed pipes 
was believed to be too low to  close the excess flow valves.
The fitting that failed (Fig. 2 and 3) was found to be signific antly corroded on the inside. The fitting was the only 
support for other piping (Fig. 2) , which weighed more than 50 p ounds. This fitting was a thread ed connection and is likely 
to not be as strong as other types of connection, such as a wel ded or flange connection.

Unloading and Loading Hazardous Materialswww.aiche.org/ccps
September 2015
•Inspect all hoses and piping when setting up to load/unload 
trucks or railcars. If anything does not appear to be in good condition, ask for a more thorough inspection by a piping expert.
•Make sure that your plant’s procedures for inspection and replacement of components (fittings, valves, hoses, etc.) for unloading operations are followed.
•Inspect piping support in loading/unloading equipment, make sure that piping does not have to support a large weight, and that it does not easily move or vibrate when used. If you believe there is a problem, ask a piping engineer to evaluate the system and recommend improvements.
•Suggest installation of remotely operated emergency shutoff valves in addition to excess flow valves in trucks/railcars.
•Consider using self-contained breathing apparatus or emergency escape respirators when loading/unloading gases or volatile liquids that are toxic or asphyxiating.www.acutech-consulting.com

What can you do?•While the things you do in your tank farm, loading and 
unloading operations, may seem simple – usually just transferring material – these facilities may be some of the most important contributors to process safety risk in your plant. The tank farm probably contains the largest inventory of hazardous material in your plant. Operations, though simple, involve large quantities. The consequence of a loss of containment may be severe.
•You cannot rely on an excess flow valve in a railroad tank car or a tank truck to stop flow in some unloading operations. These valves are designed to stop flow in case of a catastrophic failure of the tank discharge connection and will not close unless the flow rate exceeds a set value. The flow rate from a hose or pipe leak, or even a pipe failure if your unloading piping and hoses are smaller than the tank connection, may be too low to close the excess flow valve.Fig. 3 Fig. 2 Fig. 1"
"Process Safety Beacon (English) - October 2015 [2015-10-Beacon-English]","Water is often found in many places in a plant. It is used for cleaning process 
equipment and pipe, for general building and plant washing, and  as a lubricant or 
seal flush. Water is also a common heat transfer fluid – as cool ing water, mixed 
with salts or glycol for refrigerated cooling, and as steam for  heating. Water is a 
common solvent used in many processes. But water can also be da ngerous if it 
gets into the wrong place. Here are some examples.•Water as a reactive chemical: Water reacts with many materials, and the 
reaction can cause heat, pressure, or toxic reaction products. The initiating 
event for the December 1984 Bhopal, India tragedy (Fig. 1), the  worst 
industrial disaster in history, was contamination of a tank of methyl 
isocyanate with water. The reaction generated heat and pressure , releasing 
toxic material into the community causing thousands of fataliti es and injuries.
•Water as a reaction catalyst: Water can catalyze other chemical reactions 
such as decomposition. For example, contamination of a distilla tion residue 
with 1% water reduced its decomposition temperature by 100 ºC. The 
temperature of steam heating on a pipe containing the contamina ted residue 
was above the reduced decomposition temperature. The residue de composed 
and ruptured the pipe (Fig. 2). Fortunately nobody was in the a rea.
•Water as a physical explosion hazard: Water boils at 100 ºC, below the 
operating temperature of many processes. If water contacts hot material or 
equipment, it will rapidly boil and generate pressure in a clos ed or 
inadequately vented vessel. Water can explosively increase in v olume by 
1600-1700 times when it vaporizes to steam at atmospheric condi tions. In 
1947, a blast furnace in a steel mill Pennsylvania (Fig. 3) was  being prepared 
for replacement of the brick lining. Workers were improperly to ld to add 
water to the furnace while it still contained molten iron and o ther hot 
materials, in violation of standard operating procedures. The w ater boiled, and 
pressure from the steam blew a hole in the bottom of the furnac e. Molten 
metal was released and engulfed nearby workers. There were 11 f atalities.This issue sponsored by

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - November 2015 [2015-11-Beacon-English]","Early on a July 2009 morning, a truck of anhydrous ammonia was b eing unloaded into a storage tank at a 
plant in South Carolina using a hose stored on the truck traile r. Soon after the transfer began, the unloading 
hose ruptured releasing a cloud of ammonia, a toxic gas. The cl oud traveled across a highway and into a 
wooded area where it dissipated. A motorist on the highway drov e into the cloud of ammonia and apparently 
drove off of the road. She got out of her car and subsequently died from exposure to ammonia. Fourteen 
people reported medical problems, and seven were treated for re spiratory symptoms and released the same 
day. Residents in the area were told to shelter in place, and t he highway was closed for several hours. 
Approximately 7,000 pounds of ammonia were released.
The investigation found that one probable cause of the rupture was the use of an unloading hose which was 
not chemically compatible with anhydrous ammonia. Other contrib uting causes included inadequate unloading 
procedures and inadequate inspection of the unloading hose. The  hose that was used to unload the ammonia 
was clearly labeled “LPG TRANSFER ONLY” (LPG – Liquefied Petrole um Gas). The trucking company 
found that one of their LPG trailers had an unloading hose inte nded for ammonia use on board, and it is likely 
that the hoses had been switched some time before the incident.  The incorrect hose which failed may have 
been used to unload ammonia somewhere between 2 and 12 times.This issue sponsored by

Does your plant handle any material that can form a hydrate?The October 2015 Beacon discussed several hazards of wate r in process plants. Another p otential hazard from a 
mixture of water and some materials is the formation of a hydra te (more specifically, gas hydrate or “clathrate” hydrate). 
Hydrates were first described by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1810 in a  lecture to the Royal Society in England. A hydrate is a 
crystaline, ice-like solid made up of water and another materia l. Usually the other material is a gas, but it can also be a 
liquid. Some examples of materials that can form hydrates inclu de hydrogen sulfide, acetylene, methyl mercaptan, 
chlorine, vinyl fluoride, carbon dioxide, ethylene, methane, et hane, natural gas, and other hydrocarbon gases. When a 
hydrate forms it can plug piping,  instrument connections, valve s, and other equipment causing process upsets which may 
be hazardous. In addition to presence of a material that can fo rm a hydrate, generally thr ee conditions are required:
Free, condensed waterSufficient pressure (how much pressure depends on the material,  and some materials – for example, methyl 
mercaptan – can form a hydrate at atmospheric pressure)Low temperature (the temperature  depends on the material and th e pressure, and a hydrate can form at a temperature 
well above the freezing point of water)
Once formed, hydrates can be very stable, and difficult to remo ve. Clearing a blockage from hydrate formation could 
be a routine or non-routine work activity that is hazardous if not done properly. Potential hazards include the release of 
flammable, combustible, corrosive , or toxic material, or unexpe cted pockets of pressure in pi pes and equipment blocked 
with solid. It may be necessary to open pipes or equipment to c lear a hydrate blockage, with  all of the hazards associated 
with opening process equipment. If you try to remove a hydrate plug in a line by applying pressure to one side of the 
blockage, the plug may break fr ee and the solid material may ra pidly move through the pipe. This can cause a rupture if 
the solid plug impacts the pipe at a tee, an elbow, or other be nd.
The United States Chemical Safety Board recently described an i ncident resulting in 4 fat alities that occurred when 
methyl mercaptan was released during attempts to clear a line b locked with a methyl mercaptan-water hydrate 
(http://www.csb.gov/dupont-laporte-facility-toxic-chemical-relea se-/).
Make sure you know if you have any  materials in your plant that  can form hydrates. If you do handle materials which 
can form hydrates, you should understand:
What temperature and pressure conditions can result in hydrate formationWhat design features and operating procedures your plant includ es to prevent hydrate formationHow to recognize hydrate formation if it occurs
What procedures you must follow to safely remove hydrates if th ey form
Be sure to do a hazard evaluati on before doing any non-routine task such as clearing blocked equipment.

Stop tank overflows!The United States Chemical Safety Board (CSB) 
recently released the results of their investigation of a tank farm fire in a petroleum products storage facility in Puerto Rico on October  23, 2009
1. We have published a 
number of Process Safety Beacons on tank overflow 
incidents – for example, Sept. 2004, Sept. 2006, and Sept. and Oct. 2009. Notice that the last of these is the same month that the incident occurred in Puerto Rico!
The CSB report includes (Appendix B) a list of 22 
major tank farm fires sin ce 1962, and the list does not 
include all such events – the incident described in the 2009 Beacons was not included. It is interesting that 19 
of the 22 incidents listed in the CSB report involved a tank overflow. With all of the complex operations going on in many process facilities, it is surprising that putting more material into a tank than will fit is a frequent contributor to major incidents.
Unreliable instruments, inadequate procedures, and 
the lack of independent overflow protection systems on storage tanks were some of the significant operational and technical causes of the Puerto Rico incident, and likely for many of the other similar incidents.
Although the operations in your storage 
tank farm may not seem to be very complex, they may actually be more complicated than you think. There may be many interconnections between tanks, you may have to put material in tanks that are already part full, or divide incoming material among several tanks.
Your tank farm probably contains the largest inventory of hazardous material in your plant. If an incident occurs it is likely to be large.

safety pioneer Trevor Kletz often described in his talks. Materi al 
was pumped to a tank in a manual operation for many years without incident. Then, one day there was a small overflow whic h 
the operator quickly stopped. A recommendation of the incident investigation was to add a high level alarm which would shut of f 
the feed to the tank if the ope rator failed to stop flow, and t his was 
done. 
About two years later there was another overflow! What 
happened? Supervisors decided that the operator could be given other work to do while the tank was filling since there was a h igh 
level shutdown. No management of change review was done. A device that was intended to be a second layer of protection bec ame 
the primary control. When the high level instrument failed, the re 
was nobody in the area and the spill was actually larger.

Did you know that mixing some household cleaners could be fatal ? Many cleaning products 
contain aqueous ammonia. Another chemical often used in our hom es is bleach – a water solution 
of sodium hypochlorite. We add bleach to our laundry, and also use it for general cleaning and 
disinfection in the house. If you mix these two chemicals, a ch emical reaction produces toxic gases 
called chloramines. Breathing these gases can be fatal. You can  find many reports of serious 
injuries and fatalities resulting from mixing these chemicals, as well as other common household 
chemicals, on the Internet.
In next month’s Beacon we will discuss a tool called a chemical interaction matrix whi ch many 
organizations use to communicate potential hazards from mixing incompatible chemicals. http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

There have been many incidents where a static electric discharg e was the likely ignition source for a fire or 
explosion. In 2007, two incidents were investigated by the US C hemical Safety Board (CSB)1. One was 
caused by poor grounding of an intermediate bulk container (por table tank) while filling with a flammable 
solvent (1), and the other by a poorly grounded level float in a storage tank which was being filled from a tank 
truck (2). Other incidents have been caused by poor grounding/b onding of tanks, portable containers, tank 
trucks, railroad tank cars, and static discharge from people.

•Static charge is generated by contact and separation 
of two different materials. Once generated, charge may remain on the materials until it finds a lower electrical potential, then it discharges. The spark can have enough energy to ignite flammable vapors, gases, or a combustible dust cloud.
•Static can be generated by fluids flowing through 
pipes, solids through ducts, and even by air flowing through ductwork or pneumatic conveyors. 
•Mechanical conveying systems can generate static 
by rollers and belts contacting each other, especially if they slide over each other.
•Static sparks may be felt (a sharp “zap”), seen (small 
bluish arcs), or heard (a snapping sound).
•Non-conductive liquids such as benzene, toluene, 
and naphtha, generate static much more easily and dissipate charge more slowly compared to con-ductive fluids, such as water, alcohols, and acetone.
•Poorly grounded and bonded hoses are a frequent 
contributor to creating static.

•Always follow your plant grounding and bonding 
procedures before any material transfer operation.
•Make sure that grounding/bonding equipment in 
your plant is regularly inspected and tested.
•Inspect grounding/bonding equipment before each 
use to ensure it is in proper working order and that it attaches firmly (metal to metal) to the container. If it is frayed, or has a poor connection to ground, notify your supervisor.
•Inspect hoses prior to use. A damaged hose may 
have a broken grounding wire inside. Hoses should be regularly checked for electrical continuity.
•Non-metallic containers (for example, plastic or 
glass) are difficult to ground and bond. When using these containers, exercise additional caution and follow procedures. If there is no grounding specified, ask why not.
•If handling solids in plastic bags or with plastic 
liners in paper bags, ask an engineer for advice on proper procedures to prevent static sparks."

In 2014 there was a fire on a passenger vessel 
operating about a mile offshore from the United States in 
the Atlantic Ocean. A crew member making rounds in a machinery space noticed a small fuel spray fire above one of the four propulsion engines. He left the area and informed the bridge. Proper emergency procedures were followed, and the fire was quickly extinguished using the vessel’s fixed fire protection system (CO
2). None of the 
174 persons on board were injured.
The vessel was equipped with four diesel propulsion 
engines (1). Fuel was deliver ed to each cylinder through a 
threaded variable length coupling (2). There were four couplings per engine. These couplings are designed to facilitate installation by their capability to lengthen when the ends are threaded into the cylinder connections. On the passenger vessel that experienced the engine fire, couplings on three of the four  engines had been replaced 
with threaded hose fittings and rubber hoses (3). One of those hoses failed and spraye d fuel directly onto the hot 
engine exhaust, which likely provided the ignition source.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

On March 16, 2016 there was an explosion in a laboratory at the  
University of Hawaii in Honolulu. A research assistant was seri ously 
injured, losing her arm. The total financial loss was nearly $1  million.
The laboratory was conducting research using a flammable mixtur e of 
hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide . The mixture was stored in  a 50 liter 
(13 gal) tank at about 6 barg (90 psig) pressure, and fed to a b ioreactor 
containing bacteria. The tank w as rated for 11.6 barg (168 psig)  and was 
intended for use for dry compress ed air only. The tank, and oth er equipment 
such as instrumentation, was not bonded and grounded. Static sp arks had 
been observed in the laborator y with ungrounded metal equipment  prior to 
the explosion. The explosion occurred on the 11thrun using the tank. It was 
estimated by investigators to be equivalent to the detonation o f about 70 gm 
(2½ oz.) of TNT – nearly half th e amount of explosive in a US Ar my M67 
hand grenade.
The investigation determined t hat the likely immediate cause of  the 
explosion was a static  discharge (see August 2016 Beacon ) which ignited 
the flammable mixture. However, more fundamentally, there was a failure 
to recognize the hazard of the flammable atmosphere in the tank, and how easily the mixture could be ignited . A mixture of gas containing hydrogen 
and oxygen is explosive over a wi de range of concentrations, an d the 
ignition energy is extremely low. The equipment, facilities, pr ocedures, and 
training were not adequate for s uch a highly hazardous mixture of gases.http://www.aiche.org/CCPS/Pub lications/Beacon/index.aspx

Hydrogen-air mixtures are explosive in concentrations from 
4% to 75% hydrogen, and the range is wider as oxygen concentration increases – 4% to 94% hydrogen in pure oxygen.
The energy required to ignite a flammable mixture of 
hydrogen and air (21% oxygen)  is very small. A spark you 
can barely feel has about 50 tim es as much energy as needed 
to ignite the mixture, and a typi cal spark that you experience 
has over 1000 times the energy r equired for ignition. At 
higher oxygen concentrations, th e mixture is even more easily 
ignited.
Process safety incidents can occu r in laboratories or pilot 
plants as well as in manufacturing plants. A small quantity of material does not mean that the hazard is small.
This incident occurred in a research laboratory, but a plant 
laboratory may also contain enough hazardous material or energy to potentially cause a serious incident – for example, a cylinder of compressed gas in a quality control laboratory.
Wherever you work – in a process plant, a 
research laboratory, a pilot plant, a quality control laboratory, a maintenance shop, or anywhere else – make sure you fully understand the hazards associated with all of your materials, equipment, and operations. You can’t manage 
the risk from a hazard that you don’t know 
about! Hazard recognition is the first critical step 
to ensure safety in any activity. Apply the same 
discipline to process safety management in a laboratory or other work environment as you would in a manufacturing plant.

There’s more than one way to start a fire – control them all!Some ignition sources are fairly obvious. A glowing cigarette, an active 
oxyacetylene torch, or a cascade of sparks and burning metal fr om a grinder 
is hard to miss. Hot work may also leave behind glowing particl es, hot slag, 
or a smoldering fire in hidden places. A raging fire may follow  many hours 
after the work is finished.
Ignition sources from unintended chemical reactions may be “inv isible” 
too. Here are some examples:Unstable chemicals: For example, a peroxide stored above its 
decomposition temperature (#1), or chemicals with a specified s helf life 
stored too long (January 2006 Beacon ).
Incompatible chemicals stored together and accidently mixed (#2, July 2006 
Beacon ).
Enhanced oxidation by increased surface area : For example, activated 
carbon plus organic vapors (April 2003/February 2014 Beacons ), oily rags 
(May 2005 Beacon), or combustible liquids leaked into insulation.
Pyrophoric materials: Self-igniting materials (#3) are regularly reported as 
fire starters. For example, sodium hydrosulfite, a strong reduc ing agent, 
becomes pyrophoric when moist (August 2014 Beacon ). A fire on board a 
container ship in Barcelona harbor in 1996 (#4) also was initiat ed in a 
container of sodium hydrosulfite. Pyrophoric materials such as iron sulfide 
can also be formed in petrochemical installations from reaction  of oxidized 
iron (rust) and hydrogen sulfide present in crude oil and deriv atives.

•Cleanliness may not be all you need to prevent fires in your pl ant, but it is a good start!
•Look for signs of leaking (for example, discoloration) of organ ic liquids or heat transfer fluids into 
insulation as you go about your job. Report problems and make s ure they are fixed.
•Know your chemicals! What do the Safety Data Sheets state about  stability, storage conditions, hazardous 
reactions, and incompatible substances (see July 2016 Beacon )?
•Follow your plant procedures for storage and mixed material sto rage.
•If new materials are introduced into your plant, check if the p rocedures are adapted to include them and that 
a management of change review (MOC) has been done. If not, ask your supervisor to update procedures and 
consider an MOC.

three crew members (Virgil ""Gus"" Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee) in the command module (CM) of the Apollo 1 space capsule during a test while on the launch pad. The CM atmosphere was 100% oxygen at 16.7 psia (1.15 bar). The most likely ignition source was from electrical wiring. Materials that are hard to ignite in air burn rapidly in a high or pure oxygen environment
High oxygen concentration has been a contributing

If supplier or transportation comp any truck drivers unload mate rials into storage tanks at your plant, make sure they 
are familiar with your unloading facilities and can ensure that  they unload materials into the correct tank.
See the March 2009 and April 2012 Beacons (available at www.sache.org ) for other incidents in which an 
incompatible material was unloaded into a tank.On October 21, 2016 two incompatib le chemicals, sulfuric acid a nd sodium 
hypochlorite (bleach) were inadvertently mixed during a routine  delivery to a plant 
in Atchison, Kansas, USA by a raw material supplier. These chem icals reacted and 
released a cloud of chlorine gas into the surrounding community . Approximately 100 
people received medical treatme nt, several schools were evacuat ed, and about 
11,000 residents were advised to shelter indoors for 2 hours.
Similar incidents have happened in the past, all releasing chlo rine gas clouds:
•May 2013, Portland, Oregon, USA – A supplier truck driver pumped  a mixture of 
nitric and phosphoric acids into a tank containing sodium hypoc hlorite at a dairy. 
•October 2007, Frankfurt, Germany – Hydrochloric acid was acciden tly 
transferred into a sodium hypoc hlorite tank. Approximately 200 kg of chlorine 
were released, and more than 60 people were injured. The operat or who finally 
stopped the transfer was fatally injured from exposure to chlor ine.
•August 2001, Coatbridge, UK – A ta nker driver transferred sodium  hypochlorite 
solution and hydrochloric acid into the same tank at a swimming  pool. 30 people 
required medical treatment.
•August, 1993, Stockholm, Sweden – A truck driver pumped phosphor ic acid into 
a storage tank containing sodium hypochlorite at a swimming poo l.
•March 1985, Westmalle, Belgium – Hydrochloric acid was pumped in to a tank 
containing residual sodium hypochlorite.
•November 1984, Slaithwaite, UK – A plant expected a delivery of sodium 
hypochlorite, but received ferric chloride solution (an acidic solution) instead. 
The ferric chloride was unloaded into the sodium hypochlorite t ank.
•September 1984, Hinckley, UK – Hyd rochloric acid was unloaded in to a tank 
containing sodium hypochlorite.

There should not have been an explosion hazard. But the fuel ma y not only be present as a 
vapor (remember dust explosions). The investigation determined that the vessel agitator 
created a fine mist of liquid droplets (Fig. 2). The tiny dropl ets were estimated to have an 
average size of about 1 micron. I n comparison, the diameter of a human hair is 40-50 times 
larger than the mist droplets. Flammability testing demonstrate d that the mist could be 
ignited at room temperature in air – and the mist would be ignit ed even more easily in a 
pure oxygen atmosphere. The vessel contained both fuel and oxyg en – but what was the 
ignition source? Although it is often difficult to identify an ignition source for an explosion, 
the investigation determined that the most likely ignition sour ce was a contaminant, left 
over from a previous experiment in the vessel, which decomposed  and generated enough 
heat to ignite the mist.

the flash point of the liquid can be a s explosive as a fuel 
vapor-air mixture. The explosion mechanism is similar to a dust explosion, except that the fuel is present as small drops of liquid rather than small, solid particles.
A mist can be formed in many ways. In this incident, 
vigorous stirring by an agitator blade near the liquid surface generated the mist. A mist can also be created by a liquid leak from a pressurized pipe, vessel, or other equipment – for example, a flange leak, a hole in a pressurized pipe or vessel, or a leak from a pump seal.
Don’t forget that a leak from a utility or maintenance 
system can create an ignitable mist. For example, there have been incidents of ignition of mist from a leak of lubricating, heat transfer, or fuel oil.In 1986, there was an explosion in a 10 gallon (~38 l) agitated  
vessel in a pilot plant. An oxidation reaction was being done i n a 
pure oxygen atmosphere at 250 ps ig (1825 kPa). It was thought t hat 
the vessel atmosphere was safe from ignition since the vessel w as 
operating 50°C below the flash point of the contents in the oxy gen 
atmosphere, and the fuel vapor concentration was below the Lowe r 
Explosive Limit (LEL). Processi ng conditions were stable for 41  
minutes when suddenly the explosion occurred. It ruptured the 7 50 
psig (~5200 kPa) reactor, did si gnificant damage to the facilit y

injured.

What can you do?
Be aware of the potential for fire or explosion of 
a mist of flammable or combustible liquid when responding to a leak or spill. If there is a mist present, don't assume that there is no hazard because the temperature is below the flash point. Take the same precautions that you would to prevent ignition and protect people if the leak had resulted in a flammable vapor cloud.
If you observe a mist or fog inside any process 
equipment inform your management so they can ensure that proper protective measures are in place.
Promptly report any leaks of flammable or 
combustible materials, including utility fluids, if you see them in your plant.MIST"

Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Marathi, Persian (Farsi), Pol ish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Telugu, T hai, Turkish, and Vietnamese.There are many reports of steam explosions involving hot 
material unintentionally coming in contact with water (see the October 2015 Beacon for another example).
Water expands by about 1600 times when it vaporizes to steam. 
This means that one US pint (~ ½ l) of water can generate enough vapor to fill almost four  55 US gallon (~ 200 l) drums!
To prepare for maintenance, water is often used to clean or 
flush equipment. The water can collect in low points in equipment and piping and could contact hot or incompatible materials if it is not completely removed before re-start.In 1991, an explosion and fire occurred in a 50,000 barrel-per- day Fluid 
Catalytic Cracker (FCC) unit in a refinery that was being broug ht online after 
a seven-week shutdown for maintenance. Tragically, six workers lost their 
lives and eight others were injured in the event. Property dama ge was reported 
to be about $23 million and business interruption loss was esti mated to be $44 
million. What caused this terrible explosion? It was not caused  by a runaway 
reaction, or a flammable leak, or static ignition. It was cause d by – water!
The vertical pressure vessel (F7) that exploded was used to sep arate heavy 
oil from solid catalyst dust in the process. During the shutdow n, oil was 
drained from all process equipment and the equipment was cleane d, inspected, 
and refurbished to be fit for se rvice. As part of the startup p rocedure, steam 
was purged to displace any air in the system before oil was fed  to the process. 
It was recognized by operations that the temperature in the pro cess equipment 
was low enough to condense some of this purge steam into water.  So, any 
water that condensed was collected and pumped to the F7 vessel.  The normal 
startup procedure required the operating crew to drain the wate r from F-7 
before any hot oil was introduced. However, there was a block v alve in the 
wrong (closed) position that prevented the water from draining from F7. The

When returning equipment to service 
following maintenance, make sure that it is completely clean and does not contain anything that could be incompatible with process materials or operating conditions.
Do not deviate from your plant’s startup 
procedures. 
Use checklists and written procedures for 
startup. Some process plants operate for many years between maintenance and other shutdowns. You should not rely on your memory for this critical operation which you may not do very often.
If you find valves in the wrong position or 
other equipment in the incorrect status during startup, get help to understand all potential consequences before changing valve position or other equipment status.

dangerous in many different ways, for example:Holes in tanks can allow toxic or flammable vapors to escape into the surrounding environment.
Corrosion can weaken tanks, pipes, or other equipment so they can fail under normal operating conditions.
Equipment which is severely corroded may be structurally weakened. A tank top may not be able to support weight on it, corroded pipes might weaken and break, and corroded equipment supports or building structural steel can collapse.In 2001 there was an explosion in a tank containing spent sulfu ric 
acid (which contained some hydrocarbon) from a refinery alkylat ion 
process (Fig. 1). Eight workers were injured and there was one fatality. 
Spilled sulfuric acid reached a river causing environmental dam age. 
Contractors were repairing a platform in the tank farm when a s park 
from hot work ignited flammable vapors in the tank. The tank ha d 
significant corrosion, and leaks had been found annually for se veral 
years. All reported leaks were repaired, except for one discove red a 
few months before the incident. At the time of the incident, se veral 
additional holes in the roof and shell of the tank had not been  reported. 
An operator did file an “unsafe condition report” a few weeks b efore 
the explosion. A hot work permit had been rejected because of h igh 
flammable vapor concentration, but corrective actions had not b een 
taken by management.
In January 2016, there was a fatal incident in a different refi nery, 
also caused by tank corrosion. During the evening shift, an ope rator 
went to a tank farm to manually measure the temperature and lev el in 
several tanks containing hot oil (Fig. 2). This required climbi ng to the 
top of the tanks. The operator did not return for some time and  did not 
respond to radio contacts. His colleagues went to the tank farm  to 
investigate, found his vehicle parked there, and also found a large hole in the top of one of the tanks (Fig. 3). The tank was emptied a nd the 
body of the operator was discovered in the tank – he had fallen through 
the hole into the tank. The tank roof was found to have severe internal 
corrosion. The roof failed when the operator stepped onto the top of the tank.www.chilworthglobal.com
Fig. 1:  Spent sulfuric acid tank after explosion
What can you do?
Report holes in tanks or severe corrosion to management. If there is no action to correct the problem, don’t give up, and escalate the concern if needed.
Don’t ever walk or climb on equipment which is not intended for that purpose. Do not walk or climb on anything that looks badly corroded – it might not support your weight.
Report corrosion of piping, pipe supports, vessels, equipment supports, ladders, stairs, work platforms, building structural steel, or any other critical equipment.Fig. 3 :  Hole in top of hot oil tank

with different expertise in an incident investigation, or any other process safety management activity (process hazard analysis, management of change, pre-startup safety review, etc.). Everybody involved has a unique expertise to bring to the discussion, based on their education, training, and most importantly, their work experience. In this incident, the engineers and other e xperts did not recognize the 
machine tool marks on the failed pipe, and yet it was immediately obvious to the expert, experienced machinist. His knowledge c ompletely changed the 
conclusions of the investigation, and was essential for understanding the cause of the incident.In November 1998 a 12 in. (30.5 cm), 600 psig (~ 41 bar[g]) 
steam pipe in a large chemical plant failed catastrophically. A  36 in. 
(~ 1 m) long section of pipe just upstream of a decommissioned venturi flow meter suddenly ruptur ed causing major damage in the  
area (Fig. 1). Steam supply throughout the plant was lost, the steam 
generation equipment shut down,  and there was no production in 
most of the plant for more than 5 days. Fortunately there were no 
injuries or fatalities.
An investigation team was immediately formed to understand the 
cause of the failure of the 30 y ear old pipe (Fig. 2). There wa s 
concern about other steam piping which might be in danger of a 
similar failure. The team consisted of utility operating and management personnel, materials and mechanical engineers (pipin g, 
reliability, and failure analysis experts), and chemical engine ers. 
The initial suspected cause was er osion of the pipe wall immedi ately 
upstream of the venturi caused by poor quality (wet) steam, resulting in thinning of the pipe wall. Observed lines on the p ipe 
(Fig. 3) were believed to be created by erosion.
In the course of the investigati on it was determined that the p ipe 
which failed had been  designed to have a slight taper (about 10 º) to 
smooth flow to the venturi. This taper was produced by boring a

understanding the incident. S hare that knowledge and ask 
questions. If something in the discussion doesn’t sound consistent with your experien ce, make sure that it is 
resolved to your satisfaction.

The investigatio n team asked an experienced machinist to inspect the failed 
pipe. The machinist immediately recognized that the lines were not signs of erosion, but actually tool marks from a boring 
tool. When the pipe was bored, the tool had not been inserted p roperly, but off-center. This resulted in the pipe being only 
about 25% of the intended thickn ess at the top, and consequentl y weakened.

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - July 2017 [2017-07-Beacon-English]","A seemingly small change, without an adequate Management of Cha nge (MOC) 
review, can lead to a serious event. Here are two examples.
Incident 1 :  The vent system on a low pressure storage tank 20 ft (~ 6 m) diameter and 30 
ft (~ 9 m) high was modified to reduce environmental emissions. The tank had operated for 
20 years with a nitrogen blanket and a simple hinged breather v ent to provide overpressure 
and vacuum protection. The new system was much more complex, in cluding a compressor 
and more complex piping. The ta nk was returned to service and f illed. The first time it was 
emptied, the tank collapsed (Fig. 1) because it was not properl y vented. Fortunately there 
were no leaks or injuries, but  the tank had to be replaced.
Incident 2 : A tank truck owned by a trucki ng company had been modified wi th tubing so 
that a nitrogen hose could be c onnected to the tank without som ebody climbing a ladder on 
the truck. There was a valve in the nitrogen line on the top of  the truck, and it was 
mistakenly left closed. The tank truck was pumped out using a p lant pump and, with no 
nitrogen flowing to the tank, a vacuum was created and the tank  catastrophically collapsed 
(Fig. 2).  The tanker did have  a pressure/vacuum relief device,  but it failed.

but all operator training was not completed. The training focused on the new vent compressor and condenser. The training did not stress the critical importance of a ½ inch (13 mm) valve on instrument tubing which controlled pressure/vacuum protection. After the collapse, that tubing valve was found closed, and it was key to protection of a complex system. The valve should have been locked or otherwise sealed open. The design and training could have been simplified to reduce the likelihood of human error. Small details can provide opportunities for human error which have big consequences. 
In Incident 2, there was no MOC review 
for what seemed to be a minor change, which was made by the truck owner. The truck driver misunderstood the operation of a new type valve and he inadvertently left the nitrogen valve on top of the truck in a closed position when preparing to unload the truck.

Make sure you are trained on any changes to your plant, and tha t  
you understand how to operate modified equipment. Get help if you are required to operate modifi ed equipment without training .
Never make changes to the piping or equipment in your plant 
without following your plant’s MOC process.
If any equipment, existing or as modified by a change, is compl ex 
and likely to result in human error, tell management and engineering and ask them if the equipment can be simplified.
Completely understand any changes made to equipment owned by 
others, such as a trucking company, when it is used in your pla nt.
When transferring material, make sure that allvalves are in the 
correct position (see the August 2015 Process Safety Beacon ).

Read other Beacons related to this incident – May 2010 (fireproofing of structural steel) and January 2003 (inadequate 
clearance for high equipment).In October 2005 there was an explos ion and fire in an olefins p lant in Texas. A fork 
truck was towing a trailer of c ompressed air cylinders through a process unit (1). The 
trailer struck a protruding drai n valve on a strainer in a liqu id propylene pipe (2). The 
drain line, operating at 216 ps ig (15 bar-g), was severed (3) c ausing a 1.9 inch (4.8 cm) 
opening. Propylene, which boils a t -54°F (-48°C), was released (4) and rapidly created a 
flammable vapor cloud (5). The f ork truck driver  and other work ers in the area saw the 
release and immediately fled. The control room was informed and  operators immediately 
began to shut down the unit and activate emergency response pro cedures. However they 
were not able to isolate the l eaking pipe and st op the release.  The vapor cloud ignited 
about 2 minutes after the release started (6). Several workers were knocked down by the 
explosion, and two were burned, one seriously. 14 other workers  received minor injuries.
The explosion ignited a pool fir e which exposed structural supp orts for piping, 
vessels, heat exchangers, and other process equipment to flames . About 30 minutes after 
the fire began, support columns,  which had not been fireproofed , failed. Their collapse 
resulted in additional damage and loss of containment of flamma ble materials. The plant 
was evacuated, neighbors were told to shelter in place, and a s chool was evacuated. The 
fire burned for 5 days. The ma nufacturing unit was shut down fo r 5 months.

process safety incidents. For example:•Failure to follow procedures
•Silencing alarms without taking corrective action
•Failing to make rounds to check the plant status
•Doing a plant procedure without bothering to take the check she et with you. 
You may have done this activity hundreds of times, but people a re only 99% 
accurate at best. You are about 10 times more likely to leave o ut a step in a 
moderately complicated procedure if you are not using a checkli st.
While these may seem to be minor, they can have severe conseque nces. 
Improper, inaccurate or poorly used procedures have led to majo r incidents with 
many fatalities and injuries. For example, in December, 1994 th ere was an 
explosion in a fertilizer plant in Port Neal, Iowa. There were 4 fatalities, 18 
injuries, much of the plant was destroyed, and chemical release s had significant 
environmental impacts. The US EPA investigation team concluded that “the 
explosion resulted from a lack of written, safe operation proce dures” which 
“resulted in conditions in the plant that were necessary for th e explosion to occur.”
What about a task that is not easy  to do? There may be an instr ument reading 
that requires climbing many fli ghts of stairs, unlocking an enc losure to verify a 
level, or going to the far end of  the plant to check a valve po sition. It is easy to 
rationalize skipping this when you are busy. Someone else will get it next time –
just like the trash on the floor! But, if everybody behaves the  same way, the task 
will never be done.Have you ever needed to put a piece of paper 
in the trash can, but instead of taking those last 4 steps, you tossed it and missed the can? Then you walk over, pick it up, and throw it out as planned. What was gained? Actually, it took extra effort to go back, pick the trash up, and put it in the trash can. What if you didn’t go back? Someone else would have had to do it for you.www.chilworth.com
What can you do?
Always follow procedures 
completely. If procedures are inaccurate or incorrect, explain the problem to your supervisors. They want the activity to be done correctly and safely! 
When making plant inspection 
rounds, take the time to do it well and thoroughly.
If there are inspection points that 
are difficult to access, instruments that are out of calibration or not working, unknown liquids dripping from pipes, agitators that are shaking, pumps that are making strange noises, or anything else that doesn’t look or sound right as you go through the plant, note this on the rounds sheet and bring it to your supervisor’s attention. Nobody can fix a problem that they don’t know about!

The same idea applies to process safety. If you don’t do it 
right the first time, you will have to do it over! Or, somebody  else 
will have to do it over for you. However, some process safety tasks are not as obvious as trash on the floor. Not doing proce ss

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - October 2017 [2017-10-Beacon-English]","Never ignore safety alarms. Safety alarms should have specific response procedures, and you should always follow 
these procedures. Make sure you understand the response procedu res and have been trained on them.
If you have nuisance alarms, especially safety alarms, which “c hatter” or remain in the alarm condition, report the 
problem to your instrument and au tomation engineers and managem ent and work with them to fix the problem.
If you have alarms that do not require a response, work with yo ur engineers and management  to eliminate them. Do 
not change alarm set points unless authorized.
Make sure that any changes to a larm design and equipment, alarm  set points, or alarm response procedures, are 
thoroughly reviewed using your plant management of change proce dure. This includes informing all affected people 
about the change, and training on any modified procedures resul ting from the change.Do you know Aesop’s Fable “The Boy  Who Cried Wolf”? A shepherd boy repeatedly tricked villagers by calling for 
help because a wolf was attacki ng the sheep, when there was no wolf. After a while, the villa gers ignored the boy. One 
day there really was a wolf (1). When the boy cried for help, e verybody assumed it was another false alarm. Nobody 
came, and the wolf had a sheep d inner. In some English versions  of the fable from the 15thcentury, the wolf also ate the 
boy – perhaps an appropriate anal ogy for the potential consequen ces of ignoring alarms in the process industries!
Do you have alarms in your plant  which are unreliable, frequent ly giving a “false alarm” because of faulty sensors or 
because they are set too close to normal operating conditions? Would you notice if one of these unreliable alarms warned 
of a real, important deviation which requires action? Or, do yo u have “nuisance alarms” which indicate minor process 
deviations which do not require  any response? If you get a lot of these, you might fail to notice a “real” alarm!
The US Chemical Safety Board (C SB) investigated a 2010 incident  at a plant in West Virginia in which an alarm was 
ignored resulting in a chemical release into a process building  (2 and 3). A rupture disc on a reactor containing methyl 
chloride, a toxic and flammable gas, burst releasing methyl chl oride to a vent line. The r upture disc was designed to 
provide an alarm when it burst, a nd this alarm worked. However,  there was a history of false alarms, signaling a burst disc 
when it was actually intact. Operators were not aware that the device had been upgraded, and assumed it was another false 
alarm. There was a drain line with a weep hole on the vent, ins ide the process building. Met hyl chloride was released 
through the hole into an area of the process building where peo ple were not frequently present. The release went on for 5 
days before a gas detector designed for another chemical was tr iggered. It is estimated t hat about 2000 pounds (900 kg) of 
methyl chloride was released.

plant, and check for proper operation as you do your routine plant rounds.
Check the pressure in enclosures, and report 
to management if it is not in the proper range. Follow up to make sure the problem is fixed. Picture 4 shows a pressure gauge which clearly indicates the proper range.Does your plant have en closures in hazardous areas 
which must be purged with  air or other gas and 
maintained at a pressure above atmospheric pressure? Some examples include electrical equipment enclosures, enclosures for an alyzers such as shown in 
Picture 1, and even control rooms or other occupied 
rooms. The enclosures are maintained at a pressure above atmospheric so that any flow through openings 
or leaks in the enclosure will be from inside the enclosure to the outside atmosphere. This prevents flammable vapors or gases getting into the enclosure, where the electrical equipment might be an ignition source for a fire or explosion.
Usually these enclosures are purged with clean air, 
but alternatively, or from a backup system, they may have a nitrogen purge and at mosphere (Picture 2). If 
your enclosures have a n itrogen purge, or a nitrogen 
backup for an air purge, be a ware of the potential of an

Did you know?
Electrical codes and standards, which may 
vary in different countries and local areas, will tell your engineers and managers how purged enclosures are to be designed and operated.
Generally, the pressure inside a purged 
enclosure must be maintained within a specified range, and monitored (Pictures 3 and 4) to ensure that any leakage of vapor is actually from inside the enclosure to the outside atmosphere.
A pressure above the specified range can also 
be hazardous. In May 2017, an engineer was removing a 14 in (0.36 m) diameter cover weighing 12 lb (5.4 kg) from an enclosure. The enclosure had excess pressure inside, from leaking purge gas com ponents. As the cover 
was being removed, it flew off and hit the engineer in the head, resulting in a fatal injury.
(Reference:  http://safetyzone.iogp.org/SafetyAlerts/alerts/Det ail.asp?alert_id=288)

Check that all doors or other ope nings in purged enclosures are  
closed, and that the enclosure is properly sealed.
If you are doing maintenance insi de a purged enclosure, be sure  to 
get the proper permits for the w ork. Be aware of the potential 
hazard of high pressure when opening enclosures, and check the pressure before opening. Make sure the enclosure is properly closed, sealed, and that the purge is operating properly when t he 
work is finished.
If your enclosures have a nitroge n backup for an air purge, or if the 
normal purge uses nitrogen gas, be aware of the potential for a n 
inert atmosphere inside or near the enclosure. Check the atmosphere for oxygen before goi ng inside, even if there is a 
nitrogen alarm and it is not war ning of high nitrogen concentra tion.

Liquefied Gases
1
2In July 1948 a tank car filled with dimethyl ether (DME) 
arrived at a factory in Ludwigshafen, Germany. It stood in sunlight for about 10 hours when it is believed that a weld seam failed. About 200 people were killed, nearly all by the explosion of the flammable DME vapor cloud created by the leak. Nearly 4000 people were injured, the majority by exposure to toxic substances escaping from installations damaged by the blast (Picture 1).
In July 1978, a tank truck carrying propylene ruptured, 
and the released gas ignited. This occurred in a vacation area near Tarragona, Spain. The explosion killed 217 people, including the driver. 200 other people were severely burned (Picture 2).
A common cause of these accidents was a tank overfilled 
with liquefied gas. In the first incident, the tank identificat ion 
plate incorrectly showed a higher capacity than the tank car could actually hold. In the second incident the cause may have been human error when filling the tank.
What can you do? Did you know?
Energy in a pressurized container depends 
on its size, temperature, pressure, and the state of the contents – condensed liquid or compressed gas. Avoid adding to this energy by exposing containers to heat from their surroundings.
Read the safety information about gas 
containers you handle, and follow recommended procedures.
If you fill containers with a liquefied gas, 
ensure that you do not overfill them.
Read the October and December 2006 
Beacons which discuss gas cylinder safety.
You may have liquefied gases at home – for 
example, as fuel for a grill, a home heater, or a stove. Liquefied flammable gas may also be present in lighters or aerosol cans. Handle these with the same care as you would at work, and make sure that your family understands the hazards.Gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, a nd argon are shipped or stored  as 
liquids at extremely low temperature, or as compressed gas at ambient temperature and thousa nds of psig (hundreds of bars) 
pressure. 
Other gases such as ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, vinyl 
chloride, propane, LPG, and dimethyl ether (DME) condense to a liquid at room temperature under moderate pressure, and are usually shipped or stored as liquefied gas.
A vessel filled with condensed liquid contains more material th an 
the same size vessel filled with c ompressed gas – liquid has a 
higher density. For example, a c ylinder of argon gas at 2900 ps ig 
(200 bar) holds about the same amount of material as a cylinder  of 
the same size containing liquefied propane at only 116 psig (8 bar).
Liquefied gases, like most other liquids, expand when heated. A s 
the liquid expands, the vapor space in a closed container shrin ks. If 
the container becomes completely liquid filled and continues to  be 
heated, it can rupture from the pressure of liquid expansion. Thermal expansion of a liquid can generate very large pressures  
with a relatively small temperature increase. The result of the  
container rupture is a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion  –

In recent years, many natural disasters have been 
in the news all over the world. The pictures show some examples:1. May 2016 satellite photo of wildfires in near Fort 
McMurray, Alberta, Canada, showing the location of nearby oil processing facilities.
2. The Fort McMurray fires.3. Hurricane Harvey at near maximum strength in 
August 2017 as it approach es the Texas coast.
4. Flooding in Houston, Texas caused by rain from 
Hurricane Harvey.
5. Trailers containing organic peroxides in a process 
plant exploded because refrigeration systems were out of commission due to loss of electric power following Hurricane Harvey.
6. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 
Japan lost power in Marc h 2011 as a result of a 
major earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Insufficient cooling caused three nuclear reactor meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the 
release of radioactive material.
These events and others like them had, or could 
have had, significant impacts on process plants.
Know your plant emergency procedures for natural disasters and understand your role in pre paring for, responding to, 
and recovering from the event. The type of disaster which can i mpact your plant will depend on where your plant is 
located and what kind of natural events might happen in that pl ace.
Check that your emergency procedures take into consideration th at some natural events such as earthquakes and 
tornadoes may occur with little or no advance warning.
Confirm that plans consider worke rs who remain on site during a nd immediately after a natural event. The workers 
require support (food, shelter, communications, etc.), and road s and other public infrastru cture may be out of service.
Understand how your area of res ponsibility could be impacted by  a natural event, especially where there are specific 
process hazards – for example, the organic peroxide decompositio n described in item 5 above. Review the disaster 
response plans and check that th ey are thorough and complete fo r your work area.
If you identify something which you think is important, and whi ch is not covered by the existing plans, bring your 
concerns to the attention of your  supervisors so the plans can be improved.
Recognize that employees may not be able to report to work afte r a natural disaster, and that workers on site may not be 
able to go home. Be sure your p lans consider these possibilitie s, as well as the potential of limited staffing.
Develop a personal emergency plan for yourself and your family for the kinds of disasters which can occur where you 
live and work. You won’t be able to work effectively if you are  worried about your family!
Read the November 2005 and June  2011 Beacons for more advice on  natural disaster preparation.

Incident 1: A pipe containing an organic residue 
from distillation processes and liquid drained from 
process vent systems was isolated by closed valves. The pipe was steam-traced to keep the residue from solidifying. During a weekend shutdown, the pipe exploded (Figures 1a a nd 1b). Nobody was injured 
because the building was not occupied, and damage was minimal.Incident 2: A railroad tank car containing crude 
methacrylic acid (MAA) was observed to be hot 
and venting material from its relief valve. The area 
was evacuated, and after some time the rail car exploded, destroying the car and causing significant damage in the area (Figures 2a and 2b) Because people had evacuated, there were no injuries.
References: Incident 1 – Hendershot, et al., Process Safety Progress 22(1), pp. 48-56 (2003). Incident 2 – Anderson and Skloss, Process Safety Progress 11(3), pp. 151-156 (1992).
www.iomosaic.com
Most incidents have multiple causes. For each of these incident s, contamination was a contributing cause.
Incident 1: The temperature control system on the steam tracing for the pip e had failed, resulting in high temperature. 
This should not have resulted in decomposition and explosion, b ut the residue had been contaminated with about 1% 
water. Water vapor from process vessels condensed in the vent s ystem and drained into the residue tank. Laboratory tests 
confirmed that this amount of water reduced the decomposition t emperature of the residue by about 100°C. The 
temperature resulting from the steam temperature control failur e was high enough to initiate decomposition.
Incident 2: Crude MAA contains strong minera l acids from the manufacturing process which corrode stainless steel. 
The dissolved metal from corrosi on increases the tendency of MA A to polymerize. Crude MAA is supposed to be stored 
in lined tank cars, but, in thi s incident, an unlined stainless  steel tank car was used. Also, the plant did not add the 
specified amount of polymerization inhibitor to the crude MAA. The inhibitor stabilizes MAA by stopping slow 
polymerization that occurs, even in pure material. The metal co ntamination from corrosion of the tank car may have 
induced the polymerization, and the reduced inhibitor concentra tion diminished the stability of MAA, ultimately leading 
to the runaway polymeri zation and explosion.1a

When you check safety informati on (Safety Data Sheets, operatin g procedures, etc.) for materia ls in your plant, pay attention to 
possible hazardous reactions such as decomposition and polymeri zation as a result of contamination. Be aware of any specific 
contaminants of concern whic h are present in your plant.
Some contaminants are common – rus t, water, heat transfer fluids , lubricants, metals and other products from corrosion of pipes  
and equipment. Know if any of the se common contaminants are of concern for your process.
Recognize that even a small am ount of contaminant can be enough  to cause a dangerous reaction.
Follow all procedures for avoidi ng contamination in your plant and equipment. Take special car e to verify the identity of mate rials 
before unloading into storage t anks or other plant equipment.
Always use the correct materia l of construction for all compone nts when doing maintenance in your plant.
Confirm that containers you fill (pails, drums, tank trucks, ra il cars, etc.) are the corr ect material of construction.
Make sure that pipes, vessels, a nd portable containers that you  use are clean. “Clean” means free from deposits, residue, rust , or 
other contamination as appropria te and defined by your plant pr ocedures for the specific service."
"Process Safety Beacon (English) - March 2018 [2018-03-Beacon-English]","Following a major process safety incident, investigators 
often find that there were previous warnings and near misses. If these had been reported, investigated, and investigation findings implemented, the major incident could have been prevented.
We would all prefer to learn from near misses, where there 
were no injuries and damage was not significant, rather than from serious incidents.
Near misses cannot be investigated if nobody reports them! 
Near misses will not be reported if people fail to recognize the incidents as near misses, or if they do not understand their significance.
Safe process operation requires control of your process. If 
you are unable to control your process within specified safe operating limits for any critical process safety parameter you must recognize this as a near miss.

On January 28, 1986 the US Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 
73 seconds after launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida (1, 2). Th e 
Challenger was destroyed and all seven crew members were lost. 
The immediate cause was a leak o f hot gas from a joint in the s olid 
fuel rocket boosters. The hot g as impinged on the hydrogen fuel  
tank causing it to rupture and e xplode. Adjoining segments of t he 
solid fuel rocket boosters were sealed with primary and seconda ry 
""O-rings"" in the joints. Both seals on a joint failed because o f low 
temperature on the launch day. There had been several prior launches in which the primary seal had failed, but the secondar y 
seal successfully preserved the solid fuel rocket integrity. Th ese 
prior failures were near misses that were not deemed serious enough for investigation.
Failure to report and investigate near misses has been a factor  in 
process industry incidents as well. For example, on April 8, 19 98 a 
runaway reaction overpressurized a 2000 gallon batch reactor (3)  
at a plant in New Jersey. The expl osion and fire (4) injured 9 
workers, 2 seriously. Operators were unable to control the batc h 
temperature using existing procedures and available cooling. In  at 
least 6 previous batches, operators had been unable to control the 
temperature below the specified maximum, but the temperature di d 
not get high enough for a runaway reaction. These prior near-mi ss 
incidents were not investigated.

Do you know?
Understand your plant’s incident and near miss 
reporting and investigation system. If your plant doesn’t have such a system, suggest to your management that they implement a system.
Report all near misses, including failure to 
control your process within safe operating limits and operation of safety or backup systems.
Don’t assume that supervisors, managers, and 
technical staff will observe near miss events by reading shift logs, instrument records, or other process data. A plant generates a lot of data, and these events might be missed. If you recognize a near miss, it is your responsibility to make sure management is aware of it.
If you are not sure if something is a near miss, 
report it anyway. Also, think about “how bad could it have been” to help identify a near miss.
Volunteer to participate in investigations of near 
misses and incidents in your plant.

Maintaining a sense of vulnerability is an essential characteri stic of a good process safety culture. What does 
“maintain a sense of vulnerability” mean? It means that everybo dy in your plant:
Has a high level of awareness of the hazards of your processes and materials.
Is constantly vigilant for sympt oms of weaknesses that might fo reshadow more serious events. This includes 
reporting near miss events (March 2018 Beacon ).
Avoids complacency that might result from good past performance  and a good safety record.
On April 15, 1912 (106 years ago this month) the ocean liner Titanic sank in less than 3 hours after hitting an iceberg 
in the north Atlantic Ocean, with the loss of over 1,500 lives.  There are many examples of a failure to maintain a sense 
of vulnerability in the design and operation of the Titanic . For example:
The ship was perceived to be “ unsinkable” resulting in poor cri tical safety decisions. For example, water tight 
bulkheads stopped two decks below the main deck. Lifeboats were  considered “unnecessary” and the number of 
lifeboats was reduced from 64 to 16, so there were not enough f or all passengers and crew.
The captain was considered to be  overconfident in his seamanshi p and the invincibility of his ship.
The ship was traveling at hi gh speed, although its course was t hrough floating pack ice. Despite warnings about 
icebergs from other ships, at no time was any order to slow dow n given.

Do you know?
Understand the hazards of your process and materials. Know 
what the worst-case incident is, and what safety systems and procedures are in place to prevent it. Understand how you can be sure that those systems and procedures are working properly, and inform management if you see weaknesses.
Never think “it can’t happen here” or “it can’t happen to me.” It 
can!
Encourage everyone at your plant to have a calm awareness that 
the worst-case scenario can happen, and it could happen right now! Know what you can do to pre vent it, what to do if it 
happens, and always be ready to follow emergency response procedures.
Understand the potential impact of the full range of events 
which could occur in your plant, not only the “worst case” event.

explosion at an oil refinery in the state of Washington, USA (1 ). A 
heat exchanger shell failed catas trophically, and there were se ven 
fatalities. The exchanger had been in service for almost 38 yea rs and 
cracks had developed in the carbon steel shell after continuous  
exposure to hydrogen at high temperature and pressure. The fail ure 
mechanism (high temperature hydrogen attack) was not well understood when the refinery was built, and the cracks had not been 
detected when the shell was last inspected twelve years earlier .
Ensure that all facilities and equipment are operated 
within specified safe operating limits.
Report any deviations from safe operating limits to

In another incident, the roof of an ore processing plant collap sed onto the gallery below causing significant 
damage to process equipment. Fortunately, there were no injurie s. Beams on the underside of the roof had been 
exposed to steam releases from equipment below for nearly twent y years. Snow and rain on the roof caused the 
steam to condense and corrode the beams. The roof finally colla psed one winter under a heavy snow load. No one 
in the plant had been assigned re sponsibility for maintaining t he building. Operators did not routinely look beyond 
the process equipment. This incident shows the importance of ma intaining all facilities and infrastructure, even if 
the equipment does not directly contact process chemicals.

The work permit did not warn the 
maintenance crew about the nitrogen purge.
As soon as the maintenance crew decided to 
remove the roll of tape by reaching into the vessel, the scope of the job changed. The original permit did not consider the need to remove anything from inside the vessel. A new permit should have been issued, considering potential confined space entry to remove the tape.
In this case, a confined space entry permit 
was required, even for a person to reach into the vessel to remove the tape. When any part of the body of a person breaks the plane of an

A contractor maintenance crew was preparing to install a 
section of pipe at the top of a vessel in an oil refinery (1,2) . A 
work permit (3) was issued for the job, with the expectation that no confined space entry was required. The scope of work was only to install the pipe section. The permit indicated that  
“Nitrogen Purge or Inerted” was N/A (Not Applicable) although the vessel was being purged with nitrogen (4).
Workers noticed that a roll of tape had been left inside the 
vessel (5) and decided to try to remove it before installing th e 
pipe (6). They were unable to remove the tape using a long wire. At this point, a worker tri ed to get closer to remove the  
tape and was overcome by the oxygen depleted atmosphere near the opening and fell into the vessel. It is also possible that 
he may have climbed into the vessel to remove the tape, planning to quickly climb back out. The worker collapsed inside the vessel, and, to make t he tragedy worse, a co-worker 
entered the vessel in a rescue attempt and also collapsed in th e 
nearly pure nitrogen atmosphere. Both workers died from nitrogen asphyxiation.
This incident has been discussed in other Beacons – June 
2012 about nitrogen hazards, and April 2015 on the importance of work permit procedures. But there is another lesson – the importance of recognizing a change in scope of work for any job which requires a work permit. The change might introduce additional hazards which require additional safeguards.
If you issue a work permit, be sure that:
oHazards are identified and expl ained to the people doing the wo rk.
oRequired safety procedures are specified and understood.
oPersonal protective equipmen t is available and used.
oThe people doing the work clearly  understand the scope of work,  
and the need to stop work and contact you before they do 
anything not included the initial job scope.
If you are working on a j ob requiring a work permit:
oUnderstand the hazards, safety procedures, and protective 
equipment.
oUnderstand the job scope.
oAs you do the job, ensure for every step that you recognize any  
change in the scope of work. Stop the job and consult the person 
who issued the permit before you do anything not included in the 
initial job scope !
oIf you are not sure if the job scope has changed, stop and ask the 
person who issued the permit.NOAA/Institute for Exploration/University of Rhode Island

In 1996, there was an explosion of  a 600 US gallon (~2.3 cu m) batch 
reactor in a British dye factor y. The process required addition  of nitrosyl
sulfuric acid (NSA) to the reactor, containing an amine and sul furic acid, at a 
temperature between 30 and 40 °C . The reaction was exothermic – it 
generated heat. The feed typically took about 5 hours, and the feed was 
manually controlled. This process had been operating for many y ears, and 
hundreds of batches prepared without problem.
Early in the NSA feed, the batch was overheated to almost 50 °C  and the 
NSA feed was stopped. The batch was then cooled to 25 °C (too c old) and 
NSA addition was resumed. When the NSA feed was completed the b atch 
temperature could not be contro lled with the available cooling,  and exceeded 
the maximum temperature which could be recorded by the temperat ure 
instrument. The reactor was overpressurized by the runaway react ion and it 
exploded. The lower part of the reactor was propelled off of it s supports onto 
the building floor. The reactor a gitator landed on the roof, an d the top of the 
reactor was found about 500 ft ( 150 m) away. Fortunately, nobody  was 
injured. The direct cost was more than 2 million UK Pounds.
www.iomosaic.com
The rate of most exothermic chemical reactions increases as the  
temperature increases, and decreases at lower temperature. If t he 
reaction temperature is too low , the reaction will be slower, a nd 
unreacted material may accumulate in the reactor. If the reacti on 
temperature then increases, the unreacted material will be available to react. If there is enough unreacted material, the energy released may exceed the reactor cooling capacity.
At high temperature, other c hemical reactions including 
decomposition reactions which are  not important at the intended  
reaction temperature may become significant. These reactions may release more energy, and the reaction products might include gases which can generate high pressure in a reactor.
In this incident, it is believe d that approximately 30% unreact ed 
NSA accumulated in the reactor during the time that the batch was too cold. Laboratory studies and computer simulations indicated that this accumulation might not have been sufficient  
to cause the runaway. Another heat source, such as a steam leak  
to the reactor jacket, might hav e been necessary. However, the 
energy available from unreacted NSA made the reactor more vulnerable to a runaway if there were other heat sources.
It is important to ensure that reaction systems are in good 
working order, since equipment leaks and other malfunctions 
can cause, or contribute to, chemical reaction incidents.Reference:  Partington and Waldram, IChemE Symposium Series , No. 148, pp. 81-93, 2001.
Damage from other runaway reactions

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - August 2018 [2018-08-Beacon-English]","Chemicals can’t react if they do not come into con-
tact with each other. If there is no agitation in a reactor, the reaction will be slow or stop, and unreacted chemicals will accumulate. In an exo-thermic reaction this is a serious hazard. If you re-start the agitator, there will be a lot of unreacted material available and the reaction may be very fast. Your cooling system may not be able to remove the heat fast enough to control the reactor temperature.
Mixing is clearly important in a vessel containing a 
multi-phase mixture such as liquid-solid or organic-aqueous liquid phases. It is also important if the materials in the vessel are mutually soluble. In the pictures below, balsamic vinegar, which is completely soluble in water, is added to water without mixing. The vinegar sinks to the bottom of the glass and does not form a uniform solution until the mixture is stirred with a spoon.If you lose agitation in a reactor, batch or continuous, get 
technical assistance before re-starting the agitator. Gather some data to share with technical experts to help decide on the appropriate action. For example, how long was the agitator off, what was added to the vessel while it was off, what is the temperature and pressure history of the vessel?
Recognize that loss of agitation can be a problem in other 
vessels even if there is no intended reaction. Without agitation, there can be large temperature and concentration differences in the vessel. This can cause freezing on cooling surfaces, boiling near heating surfaces, precipitation of solid s 
from a solution, or settling of so lids from a slurry. Variation  
in composition of material fed from an improperly mixed vessel to other equipment can cause operating or safety issues in downstream process units.
Heating or cooling of a vessel w ithout agitation is likely to 
be inefficient, and temperature indication may be inaccurate if the vessel contents are not mixed.

In another case, a batch specialty chemical process 
included a batch distillation step to remove a reaction by-product. This normally took about 10 hours, and the distillation was determined to be complete when the temperature at the top of the column reached a specified value. The temperature sensor failed during one batch. The column top temperature indication incorrectly reached the completion temperature in about 15 minutes. The process continued to the next step. Nobody questioned the unusual behavior. Fortunately there was no safety consequence, but the batch had to be discarded.

When you work in a plant, you learn a lot about 
how it normally behaves. You get to know how long various process steps take, how long it takes to heat up a vessel, how much heating or cooling is required for a particular step, what happens to the level in various vessels when you transfer material from one place to another, what color materials are in a sight glass, what the plant normally sounds like, what it looks like, and hundreds of other things that you see and experience as you go about your daily work.
If you observe something that appears to be 
different from your past experience, it is likely that there is something which has changed in your plant. It is possible that the change is hazardous.
A runaway reaction incident described in the August 2018 Beacon occurred in a batch reactor as a result of 
failure to agitate during reactant addition. During normal oper ation, the reactor always needed cooling to 
maintain the required temperature. The runaway batch did not ne ed cooling, but rather required heating! 
Clearly there was something different, but nobody noticed or ac ted upon the abnormal behavior.
The 2005 Texas City refinery explosion is another example of no t responding to abnormal process 
conditions. In this incident, a distillation column was overfil led and over-pressurized (Pictures 1 & 2). 
Flammable hydrocarbons were released from a stack (Picture 3), and the vapor cloud ignited. Material was 
being fed to the column, while nothing was being removed (Pictu re 4), and the level instrument indicated a 
decreasing column level. The level instrument had not failed, b ut was operating beyond its design range. The

The fan in a jet engine is a pi ece of high speed rotating equip ment, and contains a lot of kinetic energy (energy of 
motion). If there is a failure, pieces of metal shrapnel can ca use major damage, and can travel a long distance. Many 
process plants also contain high speed rotating equipment – for example, compressors, centrifuges, and centrifugal

In September 2012, at an industrial site in Himeji, Japan, a 70  cu m (18,500 US gal) fixed r oof acrylic acid (AA) tank 
exploded, and a fire followed. T here was one fatality, a fire-f ighter. 36 people were injured – 2 policemen, 24 fire-
fighters, and 10 plant workers. T he tank was destroyed and near by facilities were significantly damaged (Photo 1). There 
were no major impacts to the neighborhood and environment.
The tank provided intermediate s torage between two distillation  columns for purifying AA.  Originally the tank had 
been used at full capacity. The contents were cooled and mixed by pumping from the bottom of the tank to the top. Later, 
the normal operating level was re duced to a level below the coo ling coil. The contents were no longer recirculated to the 
top of the tank, but instead to a nozzle near the bottom that w as also used to connect a level gauge (Drawing 2).
At the time of explosion, the p lant was conducting a test of th e downstream distillation column, which required 
stopping feed from this tank. The level of the tank gradually i ncreased to its original operating level. Without recycle to 
the top of the tank, the AA a bove the cooling coils was not mix ed and cooled. The temperature of the incoming AA was 
believed to be below th e onset temperature for polymerization, and the AA contained polymerization inhibitor. However, 
the temperature in the tank increased, especially at the top. T he tank eventually over pressurized and exploded.

Originally the pipe feeding the tank was hot water jacketed to 
provide freeze protection, but this was changed to steam.
Removal of a steam trap made t emperature control unreliable.
The top layer was no longer mixe d with cooler AA, and stayed 
warm from incoming AA.
There are two exothermic AA self-reactions – dimerization 
and polymerization. Polymerization inhibitor does not stop the dimerization reaction. Experiments showed that heat from dimerization raised the temperature sufficiently to start a runaway polymerization reaction.
The hazard of heat from dimerization was not recognized, so 
recirculation to the top of tank was not resumed.
The tank had no temperature indi cator. The first indication of a 
problem was observation of AA vapors escaping from the top vent on the tank.Never make any changes to your plant, even 
changes you think are small, without following your plant Management of Change (MOC) procedures.
When you see any change in your plant, ask if there 
has been an MOC review. If there has been, and you were not informed of  the change, tell your 
supervisor. You should always be informed of changes in your plant that impact your job.
If something is different from normal operation, 
confirm operating procedures or ask your supervisor what to do.
Accumulation of small changes can cause an 
incident with a big consequence. All small changes must be identified and the risk to the total system 
analyzed and adequately managed.

www.iomosaic.com
Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia is  
the busiest airport in the wor ld, serving an average of 275,000  
passengers each day. At about 1  PM on Sunday December 18, 
2017, during one of the busiest travel times of the year, a fir e 
disabled the airport’s main pow er supply and also the backup po wer 
supply. This resulted in a complete airport power outage which lasted 11 hours. Approximately 30,000 people were in the airpor t at 
the time. Hundreds of people were  stuck in airplanes on the gro und 
or diverted in the air, including a former US Secretary of Transportation. Over 1000 flights were canceled over two days, 
flight schedules were disrupt ed throughout the United States, a nd 
one airline reported a cost of 50 million dollars.
Failure of an electrical switch in a utility tunnel in the airp ort started a fire. The airport 
had two separate power supplies from separate sub-stations from  the electric company, but 
the cables for both power supplies went through the utility tun nel near the failed switch. 
The fire disabled both the main  power supply and the alternate power supply. This is called 
a “common cause failure.” A single event – the “common cause”, i n this case the fire from 
the switch – results in the failure of two or more other pieces of equipment or systems –
the main power supply and the alternate (backup) power supply f or the airport.
Common cause failures can occur in  process plants, both in norm al operations and in 
emergency situations. For example, a reactor has two high tempe rature shutdown sensors. 
Both are calibrated at the same time by the same technician fol lowing the same procedure. 
Unfortunately the technician is not properly trained and does t he calibration incorrectly for 
both sensors, so both give an incorrect temperature reading.
In the 1984 Piper Alpha North Sea oil platform disaster, fire w ater pumps which 
pumped water from the sea had been set to “manual start” becaus e divers were in the sea 
near the platform. A gas leak on the platform ignited, starting  a fire, and the fire made it 
impossible to reach the switches to turn on the fire water pump s. The fire was a common 
cause – it created the need for fire water, and also prevented a ccess to the fire water pump 
switches. There was no alternate location to turn on the fire w ater pumps."

The power of story-telling has b een recognized for centuries as  an effective way to 
impact the brain and the heart, and to preserve history. Childr en throughout the world 
learn fairy tales from collections such as Mother Goose, Grimm’ s Fairy Tales, Aesop’s 
Fables, and others. They remember these stories, and lessons fr om them, throughout their 
lives. 
Process safety pioneer Trevor Kletz (1922–2013) often wrote abou t the value of 
stories in process safety. People remember stories, and they re member them much more 
reliably than lectures on process hazards and other training ma terials. Fortunately the 
process industries have made significant progress in reducing t he frequency of major 
incidents. In the past, people working in process facilities ga ined a healthy respect
What Can You Do?

for process hazards by personally experiencing what 
can happen when a process is not properly controlled. Without that experience, we rely on training, drills, and procedures on how to go about our daily work safely. When there is no good connection between “what to do” and “why we do it that way” we can become complacent. Why do we have to follow all of these process safety management procedures to prevent incidents that never happen? We forget that incidents do not happen so often because we are following the 
required procedures. Procedures become vulnerable to not being followed rigorously. Complacency and failure to follow procedures are some of the first steps on a path leading to a future incident.
Aesop’s Fable of the Raven 
and the Pitcher reminds us of the value of creativity.
The October 2017 Beacon is based on Aesop’s Fable of the Boy Who Cried Wolf.

In 1999, a partial power outage (in this case an electrical fai lure 
without loss of steam pressure) led to a catastrophic overpress ure in 
several pressure vessels in an al umina slurry digestion/flash s ystem. 
It caused a vessel to rupture in a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vap or 
Explosion (BLEVE). The shockwave and the released hot caustic 
liquid injured 29 people – several permanently. Damage was in th e 
tens of millions of dollars. For tunately there were no fataliti es. 
The plant had been designed with several layers of protection, but on 
the day of the accident several were not working:
1. The pressure control system was in manual mode so the operato r 
could apply additional pressure  to push the slurry through befo re 
it could solidify. 
2. The high pressure interlock w as in bypass mode to give the 
operator additional flexibility  by going above design pressure.
3. The pressure relief valves had been disabled because they had  
been leaking after previous openings.
High pressure shutdown systems or other safety-related protecti ons 
should never be bypassed without f ollowing standard operating 
procedures (for example, if a safety system must be disabled du ring 
a normal startup) or using tem porary Management of Change 
(MOC) systems. Temporary MOCs may be used to manage bypasses for a short time while something is repaired, as long as you 
take other temporary measures to ensure you aren’t increasing r isk. 
It’s not unusual for relief valv es to fail to reseat completely  after 
they have done their critically important job once.
Closing the block valve under a relief device is a potentially 
significant risk increase and should only be considered after c areful 
evaluation of all mitigation options. Typical “safety system impairment standards” require following administrative measures  
like tagging, logging and communication to facility management.
Your safeguard systems are typi cally intended to be challenged by a 
real ”process demand” less than once per year. If a safety syst em is 
being activated more often than that there may be a problem wit h 
your process design. Understand the major hazards at your plant.
Know the critical safeguards against those 
hazards and be sure they are working properly.
If you regularly have to operate with 
critical safeguards bypassed or impaired, report this to management.
Do not place automatic controls in manual, 
do not bypass interlocks nor disable relief valves.
If there is no other choice while something 
is being repaired, use Temporary MOC procedures to manage disabling/impairing of safety systems for a short time, with all affected persons made aware of this.
Make sure that unreliable controls and 
safeguards are considered in Process Hazards Analysis reviews.Reference:  MSHA Report of incident on July 5, 1999 MSHA 
ID No. 16-00352
Aftermath of the BLEVE
The site was in the habit of b ypassing/disabling the safeguards  to maintain production. They rationalized this because 
their process had a tendency to solidify if it wasn’t kept movi ng (by steam pressure). When a partial power trip occurred 
the system pressure increased. However, since the pressure inte rlock was Bypassed and too many relief  valves were 
disabled, the pressure built up to unsafe levels.. 
Operate equipment within its limits all the time – with all safe guards in place. This is so important that the CCPS made it 
one of the 20 elements of its risk-based process safety program  (Conduct of Operations ).

An explosion at a large US chemical manufacturing site caused 1 6 fatalities and more  than 300 injuries. 
There were significant property damage and business interruptio n losses as well. The explosion occurred 
during startup of a distillation column. It is believed that th e trays in the column were damaged early in the 
startup. The tray damage caused poor separation. There was an a bnormally high nitrobenzene concentration in 
the bottom of the column – a concentration which was unstable.
There are many lessons from this incident (see references). Thi s Beacon focuses on one – a “bad” 
temperature indication in the distillation column. Hours before  the explosion, the column was put on total 
reflux because of startup difficulties. Later, a control system  technician was asked to replace a thermocouple 
on a tray in the column below the feed tray. The reason – it was  reading 121°C when it “should have been 
reading 102 °C.” The conclusion at the time was that the thermo couple had failed. In hindsight, the

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - June 2019 [2019-06-Beacon-English]","Corrosion under insulation (CUI) is external corrosion 
of pipes and vessels. It can happen when a corrosive fluid, including process fluids which have leaked, is trapped under insulation or f ireproofing and kept in 
continued contact with the outside of pipes or vessels.
CUI can also result from trapped water from 
precipitation or condensation of atmospheric moisture.
CUI often occurs in carbon st eel that is cold enough for 
water to condense on the external surface.
CUI occurs most often when  the operating temperature 
is between 10 and 350 °F (– 12 and 177 °C) or in cyclic service where temperatures go in and out of this range
.
Corrosive liquid may accumulate at the lowest part of 
the piping or vessel, rather than where the leak, spill, or condensation occurred.
Damaged insulation may allow water to enter. The 
insulation jacket is an important layer of protection to keep the metal pipe or other equipment dry.
A common cause of jacket failure is from people 
stepping on insulated pipe to reach something.
Insulation hides corrosion from view.
Recognize corrosion under insulation hazards!Understand which equipment in your plant is most 
susceptible to CUI. Some examples include steel pipe, pipe in cold or cycling service, and pipe containing a corrosive fluid. Your corrosion experts can provide information to help you understand CUI in your plant.
When you walk through the plant, look for damaged 
insulation, jackets, or seals where water can enter. These areas should be inspected, and the insulation repaired.
Immediately report signs of any leak that you observe. 
Look for signs of liquid inside the insulation jacket such as drips or puddles (even if “only water”), discoloration, rust stains, and blistering. Follow up to make sure the leak is repaired in a timely manner.
If insulation is removed during maintenance or repairs, 
use this chance to check the equipment for signs of corrosion. Also, remember that the job is not complete until the insulation is replaced.

"Process Safety Beacon (English) - August 2019 [2019-08-Beacon-English]","Why is this important? You can only 
manage hazards that you see and 
recognize. Chemical or petrochemical 
plants do not have many moving parts to 
show activity. This means hazards need to be identified, understood, and systems put in place to manage their safety.
Knowing the hazards is especially 
important when pipes or vessels are to  be opened. Without a good understanding of what is or was in the process equipment, and what the temperatures and pressures are, preparing for the task is difficult, and the work can be dangerous. 
Hazard Identification – the  first step for process safety!Know your process and what is in each part of 
equipment. For reactive systems, this could change with time.
Verify that pipe and equipment labeling is accurate and 
clearly visible/readable.
When equipment changes service either with different 
batches or after it has been changed physically, ensure proper review using your Management of Change 
(MOC) processes, and consider the need to update equipment labeling .
Follow line-breaking, vessel-opening and Lockout 
Tagout (LOTO) procedures.
When preparing systems for these activities, be diligent 
about completing the required permits. If there is an unclear or unresolved issue, stop and ask someone to review the situation before proceeding. Many incidents (see Beacon of June 2018) have been caused by poor 
permitting practices. This issue sponsored by

Some hazards are more obvious than 
others. We all respect a sharp knife, knowing the potential for a serious cut. 
The same can be said about a drum of 
hazardous material that has the appropriate labels. However, it is difficult to determine if a pipe or vessel is full or empty, pressurized or not. It is even more difficult to understand the hazards associated with all of the materials and energies handled in your manufacturing process. 
In a plant that was being dismantled, an unmarke d and not even documented part of piping was 
found to contain sulfuric acid, which injured an employee.

quality concern, but they can be an early 
warning that the system is beginning to fail.
Any component of the control loop could be 
failing –the sensor, the logic, or the control 
device. All three need to be checked.
A control system problem is rarely a random 
event. Although it may go away, it may return 
later and with more impact. Random events 
must not  approach safe operating limits.
If several control loops are experiencing 
problems, it could be a sign of a deeper and 
much more serious issue. Today’s sluggish 
behavior may be tomorrow’s failure.When systems do not respond as expected, 
ask others if they have seen this issue. That 
will let you know if it is a recurring 
problem.
Put a note in the shift log explaining the 
problem; this will warn others to monitor it. 
There may be a simple reason why the valve  
does not perform as it should. Take the time 
to look for possible problems. (e.g. a leaking 
airline, or a cooling system problem).
If the problem persists, write a work order to 
have the system inspected. Any component 
of the control loop could be at fault, not just 
the control valve. Sluggish control systems –a warning sign
•The control valve may be stuck by e.g. corrosion or solids settling from the fluid.
•The air supply to, or flow within, the control valve could be restricted. The sensor may be faulty 
or blocked.
•The control loop tuning may be inadequate for the actual process and needs to be reviewed.Was that normal? It should not be. 
Control loops that are well designed, 
tuned, and maintained will operate 
smoothly, maintaining process control 
with small changes to the valves 
regulating coolant, heating, feeds, or 
other process variables.
Why did this happen? What could it 
mean? Possible reasons are: Your process temperature climbs beyond the setpoint, leaving the operating 
range. The available cooling capacity is sufficient, but the control system is slow 
in bringing the process back into the operating range. Finally, the control system 
reacts as it should, and the temperature returns to setpoint.

Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Marathi, Mongolian, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish,  Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, and Vietnamese.A safety system needs to have a well-defined purpose. 
When activated, it  must reliably respond with the action, including a stop (ESD, emergency shutdown), as designed.
Do you know how these safety systems operate for  your 
processes? If you ask others how they expect these systems to 
operate, do you get different answers? There must be only one
way for each critical system to perform, and everyone needs to know it.
The objective of a process cont rol system is to keep the 
process within the critical safety control limits (see 06/2015 Beacon). It is important to unde rstand that, when the process 
exceeds the specified control limits, action is required. This can include activating the ESD system.  Operators must be 
trained in what actions to take, and when.
Safety systems, including ESDs, are designed, 
programmed, and tested to meet the safety requirements of the process and equipment. All changes need a Management of Change (MOC) review (see Beacon 07/2017). 
Safety systems, just like pressure relief devices, are there 
to protect, not to control the process (see Beacon 03/2016, “Safety Device or Control Device?”).
Safety systems have defined responses to power, 
instrument air, or other utility  failure. This information is 
often noted on the piping and instrumentation diagram (PID). 
Many companies have a Stop Work Authority policy, 
which allows, and even demands, that operators stop the process if it is out of control. Ask your supervisor or trainer how safety 
systems are supposed to operate and why that is the case. The more you know, the better your response when needed. 
Make safety systems a topic for discussion 
at the next crew or safety committee meeting. If everyone thinks the systems operate differently, you have a problem!  
During Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) or 
MOC reviews of these critical safeguards, be open and honest about what you know and what occurs in the field. Any doubt should be investigated so the systems function correctly.  What Does That Button Do? 
www.iomosaic.com
When safety systems are not well-understood, problems can become worse, 
because people may not rely on them and take the wrong actions. They might also falsely rely on the safety system and e xpect it to take actions beyond what these 
systems are capable of doing."
"201912beaconenglish","In the balloon incident, good emergency response 
training, practice, and drills enabled the site 
personnel to deal with the emergency situation, 
although this one had never been anticipated. 
Apart from mechanical damages and direct fire 
hazards, flying objects may collide with overhead 
uninsulated power lines and cause short circuits & 
further consequences. This is regularly reported for 
those popular helium -filled decoration balloons 
made from PET foil with metallic surfaces.What can you do?This issue sponsored by

Unmanned aerial vehicles or systems (UAVs, UASs ; drones ) have recently become widely available for all sorts 
of purposes. In addition to entertainment, they may be legitimately used for visual inspection in industry, 
agriculture, environmental sciences, monitoring, surveying, deliveries, etc.
They are now seemingly as numerous as model airplanes. There is concern that drone use in industrial sites and 
collision with equipment can cause damages, even fires/explosions. Recently there was an incident that involved 
a military drone in the process industry. 
Did you know?
When you go for your control rounds, also check the 
sky.
Report anything that threatens to fly over the plant 
grounds –apart from birds, of course.
Be especially vigilant when it is the season for 
fireworks, sky lanterns and hot air ballooning.
If there is a chemical plant, fuel store, or similar near 
where you live, advise your neighbors of the hazards 
if they plan activities involving fireworks or drones.
If your facility uses drones, that activity should be 
permitted work like any other non -routine work.In the course of festivities, skyrockets and other aerial fireworks can 
end up where flammable or combustible material is stored or handled, 
thus introducing a source of ignition. 
Fire balloons (aka sky lanterns) are often used as an alternative to 
fireworks; they are sources of ignition as well –and they can travel 
much longer distances. There has even been one example where hot air 
balloonists could not avoid being driven towards a factory site, making 
an emergency landing inside a plant (see photo below and Beacon of 
April 2007: Mr. Potato Head is Down ).

A sugar mill had been operating for over 100 years; 
poor housekeeping procedures allowed sugar to 
accumulate around equipment and on structures.
A plugged chute created a dust cloud that ignited 
and caused other explosions and fires. 14 people were 
killed, 38 were injured, and the plant was destroyed.
Sugar is combustible; while it is hard to ignite, explosions provide more than enough energy to cause 
damaging explosions and fires. 
The initial explosion created additional explosions fueled by sugar residue left in the process areas. The first 
event would have been severe, but the presence of accumulated sugar allowed secondary explosions and fires 
that greatly increased the impact. Housekeeping practices at that site were not well followed. Over years, a 
number of fires had occurred that were reported, but corrective actions were not effective nor sustainable. 
(Ref CSB Investigation -Imperial Sugar Fire & Explosion 02/07/2008 report 2008 -05-I-GA-6  -09/24/2009)
Accumulated materials, from your process and also 
packaging materials (plastic, paper/cardboard, wood), 
become fuel in the event of a fire or explosion. 
Minimizing it through housekeeping is essential.
Safety systems such as fire protection may not be 
designed for extra fuel, including dust or other spilled 
materials.
Spills & leaks of raw materials, process intermediates or 
finished products also represent lost material decreasing 
the process yield.
Housekeeping is more than removing spills; other clutter 
such as unused equipment and packaging need to be 
properly stored.
Metals as dust or filings are also fire and explosion 
hazards. They need the same level of care as other 
combustible materials.Know the housekeeping expectations for 
your area and follow them.
Ensure that proper handling and disposal 
methods are applied for materials that are 
collected during housekeeping activities.
Metallic wastes are a unique hazard that 
requires special disposal methods; find 
out what they are and follow them.  
Also, if  the material source is unknown, 
consult with safety personnel about 
proper PPE for clean -up.
Note substandard housekeeping during 
rounds and report this to your supervisor. 
Better still, clean them up then and there 
while applying proper safety methods.
Keeping areas clean makes them safer!

Did you know?“I think this is the right valve –maybe I 
should ask the senior operator. No, he’s 
busy, I’m pretty sure it’s right.”
“I am pretty sure this calculation is  
right, but if I ask, I’ll look stupid. I’ll just 
go with it.”
“The ID number  on this instrument is 
hard to read. It surely is the right one; I’ll 
take it off -line for calibration. The panel 
operator will tell me if it’s wrong .”
What’s the difference between what we “ think ” and what we “ know?” –A LOT!! What we do is 
based on our experience (good or bad), and what we remember to be correct. That means there is a 
reasonable chance our actions could be wrong. Knowing means acting on what has been determined 
to be correct based on accurate information and procedures. And proper thinking, not guessing or 
assuming. It is better to delay the operation and confirm what is correct rather than proceeding and 
having an upset, spill, or worse. 
CSB (Report No. 2016 -02-I-LA, and a video ) analyzes a fire following the release of isobutane 
during the attempted repair of a valve; the operators did not know the specific procedure for that 
valve and did not consider the possible hazards.  The operators did not “ know ”.
Chemical operations require a high degree of 
operational discipline –doing the right thing 
the right way every time . 
Industry has moved to computerized basic 
control systems; but this makes it even more 
important that people know what they are 
doing is correct.
No matter what job you perform, doing it 
correctly is important. Some errors are more 
detectable than others. If an error is less 
obvious or has no immediate consequences, 
it may go a while before it is discovered 
either by observation or by process deviation.If you do not know, if you doubt, just ask! Looking 
stupid is less of a fault than causing an accident. Your 
question may produce benefits to others by review of 
training or reassessment of the problem you asked 
about.  
Keep yourself informed about all procedures touching 
your job and follow them. If you see contradictions, 
remember the first point above
Respect the advice of those who point out where you 
may be wrong –it is help, not an insult. And when 
you see others about to make a mistake, ask them if 
they are sure they are doing it right.

incompatible materials combined in the truck.
Another cause is presence of flammable liquids:
Vacuum trucks operate at lower pressure, 
which can cause low -boiling material to 
vaporize. These vapors can exit through the 
truck’s vent and could ignite.
Vacuum trucks can draw in liquid and some 
air, which can create a flammable mixture in 
the vapor space of the truck and generate 
static electricity due to the mixing of liquids 
and air.
The mixing and turbulence inside a vacuum 
truck are ideal for static generation. Many companies use permit systems to safely 
manage vacuum truck operations. If you are 
working near a vacuum truck, make sure all 
aspects on the permit are completed correctly.
 Vacuum trucks collect materials from many 
sources. Before starting, make sure your material 
and what is in the truck are compatible. If you are 
not sure, stop and ask.
 Verify all vehicles being loaded or unloaded are 
grounded and bonded –including vacuum trucks. 
 Vacuum trucks can be used anywhere. If the vent 
discharge can contain flammable vapors, make 
sure it will not contact any ignition sources.At a wastewater facility in Santa Paula (Southern California), on November 18, 2014, a vacuum 
truck explosion sprayed hazardous material over the site and sent dozens, including three 
firefighters, to hospital.
Sodium chlorite , an oxidizing agent, was identified in the months following the disaster. 
Apparently, the chemical was being using as a water treatment agent for the first time. It was 
vacuumed into the truck, which was used for disposal of other materials. The combined substances 
interacted, causing an explosion that blew off the back of the truck and spread the contents across 
the area. Upon release, the mixture dried and started to burn. Explosions spread the fire to 
surrounding containers, sending billowing black smoke into the sky and forcing police to shut 
down several roads. Residents within one mile were subject to mandatory evacuations, and those 
within three miles were ordered to shelter in place.

"202004beaconenglish_1","During shutdown, the mist separator and 
its drain had been cleaned and emptied.
The start -up procedure did not require 
filling the water seal before starting the 
blower. With the drain blocked by the 
check valve, the water seal was filled by 
the water precipitated from the air. So it 
was empty at start -up.
Dust particles held back by the mist 
separator stuck open the check valve. This 
allowed a stream of air to flow 
continuously back up the drain line.
By this stream, water from the separator 
was carried into the blower intake and did 
not effectively fill up the seal.
While the actual hazard was the shrapnel 
from the suddenly stopped pulley, its 
origin was the air entering from the drain.
Failure of the check valve (perhaps long 
before the shutdown, with the water seal 
filled) could not normally be observed.
Think about your start -up procedures –and follow them!During process hazards analysis, components whose failure 
has serious consequences are identified as Safety -Critical 
Equipment (SCE). Know them and understand their 
function.
Make sure the Safety -Critical Equipment in your plant is 
properly inspected and maintained by qualified persons.
Understand why the valves and check valves are provided in 
the process design. Consider what can happen if they do not 
work properly. If you take part in a process hazard analysis, 
make sure that all failure modes of valves are considered.
Failure of internal parts of equipment, as well as piping 
components such as valves, may not be visible. If you 
suspect that any SCE component of your plant, especially 
one that is hidden (under insulation or behind other lines), 
may not be working properly, report your concern to 
engineers and management.
Make sure all valve positions, the status of all equipment, 
and process conditions (including correct liquid level in 
vessels) are identified in start -up procedures. They need to 
be as specified before start -up: this is part of “Operational 
Readiness”.This issue sponsored by

Figure 2. Blower pulley driven by motorA plant was restarting after a shutdown. The pulley of a double -lobe 
blower on a mist separator vent line (Figure 1) suddenly broke while 
rotating, explosively expelling fragments. Fortunately, the pulley guard 
(Figure 2) captured the fragments.  If the guard had been intended only to 
prevent contact, or removed for inspection, anybody nearby could have 
been seriously injured or killed. 
A significant amount of water was found inside the blower. The water 
came from the separator, which was designed to retain mist and small 
amounts of fibrous dust from the process. The water stopped the rotating 
lobes suddenly, shearing them off; their fragments were retained by the 
blower casing. Rotation of the pulley shaft was also stopped and this, 
combined with the continued rotation at the pulley rim, caused the pulley 
to break.
The separator drain line contained a water seal (Figure 1). This and a 
check valve were there to prevent reverse flow of air, enabling the 
separator to operate at slightly negative pressure.

Did you know?
•Recognize when activities require a permit and follow the 
permit procedures.
•Do not take any shortcuts with preparation activities or 
completing the permit. If contractors are performing the  
permitted work, make sure they are aware of conditions and 
perform their part of the permitted work properly 
•After activities are completed, visit the worksite to verify it 
is ready to be returned to service and that all safety systems 
are functional.
•If you are assigned a role in a permitted activity, take it 
seriously. Your life and that of others may depend on it. On November 9, 2010, in upstate New York, USA, a contractor was welding 
new support brackets on a tank for water -based polymer slurry. The area outside 
the tank had been monitored for flammables and approved for hot work, but the 
inside of the tank was not tested. An explosion occurred; one person was killed 
and another one received first -degree burns and other minor injuries.
Several factors including residues of flammables in the slurry, an overlooked 
connection to the slurry tank, and a piping leak inside the tank allowed 
flammable vapors to accumulate; these were ignited by sparks from the hot 
work (Reference: Chemical Safety Board Investigation Report #2011 -01-I-NY). 
Activities that are not performed on a regular basis may require a work permit. 
Permits are usually a checklist that require someone to insert information, and 
another person to review and approve. Examples of permitted work often 
include: Confined Space Entry (CSE), Hot Work, Lock -Out Tag -Out (LOTO), 
Line breaking/Equipment opening. Some companies use permits for other non -
standard activities such as moving and setting cranes, vacuum truck use, and 
disabling safety systems. Serious incidents in the chemical industry often 
involve these or other permitted activities.
•Some non -standard activities require 
safeguards to be removed or disabled during 
the work. This means the usual alarms may 
not be active, or a safety system may not be 
available. 
•During special work, valves may be placed in  
different positions due to changed process 
conditions. This should be noted on the 
permit. 
•Contractors may be performing work as part 
of the permit and may not understand your 
systems.
Aftermath from a fatal 
fire and overpressure 
during hot work.
Permits provide a checklist to verify the unique hazards are properly understood and managed before, 
during, and after the activities. 
Before–All requirements on the permit must be reviewed and approved BEFORE the work starts.
During–Activities in the area must be monitored to ensure things do not change  (e.g. CSE atmosphere 
or flammable levels) as work progresses.
After–Equipment and process or physical conditions that were changed during the permitted work must 
be verified to be in the proper condition before operations are resumed.

"202006beaconenglish","•Identify the failure position for safety critical 
valves in your plant. Note that P&IDs typically 
indicate the loss of utility (e.g. power, air, etc.) 
failure state of the valve.
•Recognize that a valve may fail to operate for 
many reasons in addition to loss of utilities. It is 
important to observe valve operation in the field 
to detect valve problems and report them.
•If you participate in hazard identification 
activities such as Process Hazard Analyses 
(PHA), Management of Change (MOC) reviews, 
or design reviews, consider the consequences of 
failure to operate as intended for valves. This 
includes potential consequences if the valve fails 
to operate or fails in a position other than its 
designed loss of utility failure position.

Clearly the answer is YES or we would not have asked the question! On piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) 
or other process safety information (PSI), valves may be indicated as “fail open,” “fail closed,” or “fail in last position.”
This indicates what the valve does in case of utility failure –usually instrument air or electric power failure. 
•A mechanical linkage connects Valve 1 positioner (grey 
box) that receives the control signal to the valve actuator. 
•With a working linkage the valve stem moves from an open 
(2) to closed (3) position as the air pressure signal changes. 
When the linkage failed (4), the valve remained closed.
•Recognize that a valve may fail to operate for many reasons 
other than loss of utility: 
a mechanical component could fail or be missing,
valve components may be rusty or dirty  causing it to stick
material inside the valve can cause it to stick. Did You Know?In the batch reactor system in Figure 1, the reactor contents were initially heated with steam on the heat exchanger. 
When the batch reached the required reaction temperature, steam was shut off and chilled water was turned on to the 
heat exchanger to control the reactor temperature. The water flow was controlled by Valve 1, which was a “fail open” 
valve; it required instrument air pressure to close the valve.
On the day of the incident, the reactor temperature began to 
increase, causing a high temperature alarm. The operator 
observed  the signal to Valve 1 as “full open”. The reactor 
temperature continued to increase, eventually triggering high 
temperature and low cooling water flow alarms. The operator 
was unable to troubleshoot the problem over a 7 -minute 
period and did not open the Emergency Cooling Bypass to 
increase cooling water flow to the reactor. The emergency 
shutdown system intervened and dumped the reactor to a 
containment pit. There were no injuries, but an 
environmental release occurred.www.iomosaic.com

Screen capture of the explosion in the US CSB animation 
video of the incident (CSB REPORT NO. 2003-01-I-MS)• Some chemicals, especially when 
heated, can decompose, creating more heat and even exploding. 
• Chemical reactions may continue at a 
slower rate below the usual reaction temperature and reach decomposition conditions given enough time.
• Chemical reactions can take place 
where they are not expected – like distillation columns or storage tanks.
• During shutdowns there may be 
distractions; crews may be performing different tasks or be working in different areas.
• Procedures may lack detail for non-
standard operations like temporarily idling or shutting down with materials still in the process.
An explosion on October 13, 2002,  propelled large fragments of 
debris offsite, some landed near c rude oil storage tanks. Three  
people were injured, but fortunat ely, no fatalities occurred.
Steam leaking through manual  block valves heated crude 
Mononitrotoluene (MNT) inside a vacuum distillation column, whi ch 
was shut down and thought to be isolated. The column contained 
about 1,200 gallons (4. 5 m³) of MNT, an ener getic and reactive 
material which can decompose vi olently when heated. The materia l 
decomposed over several days, r esulting in a runaway reaction a nd 
explosion. Debris from the expl osion caused a  s torage tank fir e 
and numerous smaller fires both onsite and offsite. 
Low product demand delayed start up, but the MNT column was 
kept in total reflux, until the plant-wide shutdown was complet ed. A 
fire elsewhere caused operators to isolate heat sources to all 
columns including the MNT column  by closing manual steam block 
valves and control valves. However , the valves on the MNT colum n 
were leaking through, and the tem perature of the material in th e 
MNT column did not drop but c ontinued to rise, exceeding 450°F 
(232 °C) in about 8 days. There was no alarm, and there is no 
evidence that Operations personnel actively monitored the 
column temperature control system. Did You Know ?
• Follow procedures and equipment 
isolation plans when equipment is shutdown.
• During shutdowns or temporary 
operations, continue to monitor process parameters and alarms.
• If chemicals are left in idled equipment, 
they need to be monitored and kept within safe limits; if those limits are exceeded, take appropriate action and notify the supervisor. 
• If you notice block valves leaking 
through, have them repaired or replaced. Do not expect flow control 
valves to serve as block valvesProcess interruptions: a threat to process safety

August 2020 Where to Check the LFL Before Hot Work?
Test in ALL the places where flammable vapors could be ignited !•Sparks from flame -cutting, welding and grinding can  
bounce a long way. That is why most permits call for 
removing combustible materials and testing for flammable 
gases within 35ft (10.7m)
•Gravity can pull sparks and hot particles down to the 
ground –and even down into pits and sumps. Monitor LFL 
under where elevated hot work is performed
•Most flammable vapors are heavier than air, so they tend to 
accumulate in low spaces, including sewers and sumps. 
•Even lighter flammable vapors can linger in places with 
poor ventilation –like inside pipes, vessels, or  
containment walls.
•Contractors and Maintenance Workers don’t know your 
process. They don’t know all the places to look for 
flammable vapors.
•Conditions can change while hot work is being performed. 
Process operations, upsets, or even weather conditions can 
introduce flammable materials near where hot work is 
being performed.
•Check every opening and sump within the 35ft (10.7m) zone 
or “bell” or the distance specified by your company. 
•Some companies require retests LFL frequently to manage 
changing conditions. Monitor the affected  area to maintain a 
safe condition.
•Use your knowledge of the process area to think of places 
where flammable vapors or combustible liquids and solids 
could exist
•Use the “wands” or sample tubes that come with your gas 
detectors to check inside spaces
•Use Welding blankets and other protections to stop sparks 
and particles getting to places where they shouldn’t. BUT 
DON’T COUNT ON THESE ALONE!  Locations to be checked for LFL before & during hot workDid You Know?

There have been many fires and explosions in 
our industry over the years due to ignition 
during spark -producing Hot Work. The May 
2020 Beacon covered the fatal consequences 
from one such event. One element of preparing 
for Hot Work is to check for –and prevent –the 
presence of combustible materials and/or 
flammable vapors “within 35 ft (10.7m)”. 
(* The recommended distances from both US OSHA 
and the National Fire Protection Assoc.(NFPA)).
Many companies check for flammable vapors at 
all places where the sparks from the hot work 
could be expected to bounce. The diagram 
shows some locations to be checked. LFL gas 
detector readings need to check around the 
location of the hot work itself, as well as every
place around and below where the hot particles 
could bounce. This includes using a probe (or 
sampling hose) to check inside open process 
pipes or  inside sumps and process drains such 
as points 5 -9.  21

Hand Sanitizer Hazards at Home and Work September 2020
•Some hand sanitizers are alcohol -based and are 
flammable with flashpoints of 62 to 80 °F (16.6 to 
26.7°C). Once above the flashpoint, the vapors only 
need an ignition source to start burning. 
•Many hand sanitizer solutions have a Safety Data Sheet 
(SDS) that list hazards and precautions including 
flashpoint.
•Hands wet with alcohol -based sanitizer can be ignited 
by a static spark or any other ignition source. People can 
carry a static charge large enough to ignite flammables. 
•Alcohol fires burn with a very light blue flame that are 
hard to see.  Water can quickly extinguish a small 
alcohol fire. 
•Some hand sanitizers contain methanol or methyl 
alcohol1which is flammable and toxic. Do Not Use 
these on your skin!Burns caused by a fire from hand sanitizer ignition
1. https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug -safety -and-availability/fda -updates -hand -sanitizers -methanol
•When using alcohol -based lotions or sanitizers, allow 
them to completely dry before doing other tasks that 
may ignite them.
•Read the SDS for all materials you handle even those 
that are seemingly harmless.
•Store alcohol -based hand sanitizers according to the 
SDS and away from light and heat sources which can 
increase flammability and reduce their effectiveness.
•Share this information with your family and friends so 
they do not have a similar incident.An employee used alcohol -based hand 
sanitizer, according to current 
recommendations for COVID -19 personal 
hygiene.
After application, but before the liquid 
sanitizer had fully evaporated and dried, the 
individual touched a metal surface where a 
build -up of static created an ignition source. 
The sanitizer ignited, resulting in an almost 
invisible flame on both hands. The individual 
managed to extinguish the flames but was left 
with 1stand 2nd degree burns .
Ref: International Association of Oil & Gas 
Producers (IOGP) Alert 314  IOGP Safety. 
(https://safetyzone.iogp.org/ ).
There have also been cases where shortly after 
applying hand sanitizer, the person lit a 
cigarette and their hands were engulfed in 
flames.

October 2020
On August 4, 2020, a massive explosion occurred in 
Beirut, Lebanon that killed at least 160people, injured more than 5,000 and left an estimated 300,000 people 
homeless*. At this time, no estimate of damages or cause 
of the explosion areavailable. The material, ammonium 
nitrate (AN), is a common fertilizer, but is also used as a 
blasting agent in mining. Approximately 2750 tonnes (3030 
US tons) were stored in a warehouse for over 6 years. 
Local officials were aware of the material’s presence and age, but insufficient efforts were made to manage the

November 2020 Not all vibrations in process equipment are ‘good vibrations*’
A new compressor system was starting operation 
(Diagram A) The pressure gauge connection was 
modified during a temporary troubleshooting 
procedure. (Diagram B). A longer pipe was left in 
place and the pressure gauge reattached to it. Vibration 
from the compressor and the longer pipe increased the 
amount of movement. The connection failed and 
caused a large release of flammable vapor which, 
fortunately, did not ignite, but caused a significant 
environmental release.(Diagram C )
In another incident, during a routine walk -around, an 
operator pointed out a pipe that was moving about 1” 
(2.5cm). He explained that this was seen when the rotor 
on a wiped film evaporator was out of balance. The 
imbalance forced a 50% reduction in production to 
meet quality limits. After repairing the main bearings 
and the evaporator rotor,  the movement disappeared, 
and the production rate returned to the normal level. 
Vibration is the process telling you something is wrong. Listen to it !•Vibration can be caused by several things:
oimbalanced rotating equipment
oflow induced vibration
opulsating equipment such as reciprocating 
pumps
oequipment subject to ocean waves
•Fluid shock or ‘hammer’ can be caused by rapidly 
stopping or starting flow. 
•To isolate vibration, flexible connections may be used, but 
they are also weaker components that can fail.
•Rotating equipment may have vibration monitoring 
sensors with alarms to warn of excess vibration and 
impending failure.
•Both the amplitude (amount of movement) and the 
frequency (rate of movement) can affect how quickly 
vibration can cause equipment to fail.
•Technology exists to test and analyze vibration to 
determine the exact source.
•When walking through the plant, watch and listen for 
vibrating equipment and report concerns to your supervisor. 
You may see or hear something  that is not being monitored 
by maintenance inspections
•Changes in vibration can go unnoticed. If the vibration 
seems worse, it may indicate an impending failure.
•Vibration monitoring alarms are indicating a pending 
equipment failure. They should be taken as seriously as 
other process alarms. When you notice vibrating pipe or 
equipment follow your procedures for reporting equipment 
problems. Did You Know?

December 2020 Reactive chemistry incidents can happen anywhere!
Do you think that you do not have to worry about 
potential reactive chemistry incidents because your 
workplace has no intentional chemical reactions? Don’t 
be fooled –reactive chemistry incidents can happen 
almost anywhere. Here are two examples.
On November 7, 2019, in Burlington, Massachusetts, 
USA, a restaurant employee accidently spilled a cleaner 
called “Scale Kleen” on the floor. Later, another 
employee began to clean the floor using a different 
cleaner, called “Super 8.” These materials react to 
release toxic chlorine gas. The restaurant was 
evacuated. Unfortunately, the restaurant manager was 
overcome by the fumes and died in the hospital. 
According to the material safety data sheets, Super 8 
contains nearly 10% sodium hypochlorite (bleach),  
more concentrated than the usual household bleach. 
Scale Kleen contains both nitric and phosphoric acids, 
at a total concentration of nearly 40%.
A few days later (Nov. 19), at a restaurant in nearby 
Woburn Massachusetts, two cleaning solutions were 
mixed, and toxic fumes were released. The restaurant 
was evacuated, and three people were hospitalized as a 
precaution.
Never mix materials unless you know it is safe!•Many materials used in cleaning and maintenance operations 
are potentially reactive with other substances. This includes 
cleaning products; their reactivity may be one of the reasons 
they make good cleaning agents. 
•The reactivity of bleach with other materials, such as acids, is a 
known hazard. The June 2016 Beacon discusses the reaction of 
sodium hypochlorite bleach with ammonia to generate toxic 
chloramines.
•Potentially reactive cleaning materials may contact your process 
chemicals if they are not completely removed from the 
equipment following cleaning operations.
•Read the safety data sheets for all materials used in your 
workplace., including those used for cleaning, maintenance, 
lubrication, water treatment, and utilities such as heating or 
cooling fluids.
•Recognize that safety data sheets cannot describe allpotential 
reaction hazards of a material. Ask a chemist or other technical 
expert about potential reactivity hazards among the specific 
materials in your plant.
•Consider all  potential reactivity hazards whenever you bring a 
new material into your plant.
•Follow cleaning procedures rigorously, especially make sure all 
cleaning agents have been completely removed before returning 
equipment to service.
•Never mix materials without understanding potential reaction 
hazards and necessary safeguards.
•Read the June 2016 Beacon (available at 
https://www.aiche.org/ccps/resources/process -safety -
beacon/archives ) for more information about bleach reactivity 
hazards.
•Share this Beacon with family and friends –this type of incident 
can happen anywhere, including your home!Did You Know?

January 2021 Material identification –the first link in the process safety system
An operator was adding a raw material from many 
drums. All the drums were black with white ends and had 
blue & white labels. After adding ~20 drums, the 
operator noticed a drum that had a different name on it. 
Same black and white drum, same blue and white label. 
It was a different material than specified. He called the 
engineer who told him not to add the drum and isolate it 
until proper handling could be determined. 
What would have happened had he blindly added that 
material? That is unknown, but at a minimum, it would 
have been a major quality problem, cost the company a 
lot of money and perhaps a missed order. 
What safeguards failed? The supplier made an error 
when loading drums onto the pallets. The person 
receiving the material at the company warehouse also 
missed the one odd drum among many were received in 
that shipment. All these systems are based on people 
following their procedures and paying attention to what 
was being handled. 
Like this example, many chemical handling operations 
are highly reliant on people performing their jobs 
correctly. ""Many process safety systems depend on 
chemicals being correctly identified when received. 
Electronic scanning of incoming materials can improve 
accuracy of receiving  chemicals IF they are properly 
labelled by the supplier.
Properly receiving chemicals is a critical step that protects all processes downstream. •Chemical receiving systems, whether containers or bulk, are based on 
administrative controls. People need to follow their procedures and be 
attentive to details all the time. A brief lapse in attention can result in a 
serious event. 
•Humans make mistakes despite the focusing their attention on the task 
being performed. Even highly trained personnel like pilots and astronauts 
are only 99% correct. 
•Some companies use the “four -eyes principle.” This means having 
another person observe the set -up or operation to verify the procedure 
is being followed and all . There have been many incidents where a bulk 
material was pumped into the wrong tank with serious consequences. 
Some of the impacts were overfilling and a spill. Other errors resulted in 
reactions, fatal toxic releases or contamination of the tank and financial 
loss. 
•Many containers look the same –drums, IBCs, and railcars. That makes 
proper labeling very critical.
•Many bulk loading/off -loading events have been caused by using 
incorrect equipment –wrong hose material or using the wrong fork truck 
to move semi -bulk containers like Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) for 
liquids and Flexible Bulk Intermediate Containers (FIBCs) for solids.Chemical containers often look very similarDid You Know?

•Always follow the procedure for handling materials in bulk or in 
containers and whether using the containers of material as a 
customer or filling them as a supplier. If there are errors in the 
procedure, mark -up the errors and give them to your supervisor for 
editing.
•Use only approved equipment for chemical transfer whether in 
containers or in bulk. 
•Pay extra attention to the labels both those that are on the container 
from the vendor and those being applied for internal use. Even very 
small containers like lab samples need to be properly labelled
•Bulk shipments have a different types of labeling, when receiving 
these verify the contents BEFORE off -loading. Some companies 
sample the shipment for lab analysis to verify the contents vs 
accepting shipping paperwork. When shipping bulk containers verify 
all the documentation is complete and correct.

Static discharges are frequent ignition sources
Generating static is easy. Controlling static takes extra diligence.Static can  ignite vapor -air mixtures inside tanks. 
Flow of liquids, gases and solids, through pipes and ducts can 
generate static electricity.
A spark of  0.2 to 0.3 millijoules (mJ) can ignite flammable 
vapors. A static spark from a person can have 100 times that 
energy.
Generally, static has to accumulate on an ungrounded 
conductor (usually metal) –like the level gauge or the steel 
weight.
There are several ways to reduce static:
1.Ground and bond all equipment handling 
flammable or combustible liquids.
2.Preventing free-fall of flammable liquids into 
vessels.
3.Using conductive materials for all parts of the 
system.
Synthetic materials, such as nylon, can promote generation of 
static; these materials may be used for flexible intermediate bulk 
containers (FIBCs) or filter media. 
Most fire -retardant clothing (FRC) has low static generating 
properties .
Ground and bond all containers when transferring flammable 
materials or combustible solids. 
Many operating companies operate their filling operations to 
prevent flammable mixtures, by bottom filling, and/or using inert 
gases to prevent a flammable atmosphere in or near the 
container .
Inspect the grounding cables and clamps in your area, to 
provide good contact they should be: 
Clean to provide intimate contact between the 
clamp and container
Sharp to penetrate paint or rust on the container
Strong enough to clamp tightly
Inspect ductwork used for transporting combustible solids or 
dusts to verify all sections are grounded or bonded together. Figure 1. IBC filling operation before fireDid You Know?

A U.S. company had fires at 2 of its locations about 100 
days apart. Both were caused by static sparks igniting 
flammable liquids and vapors.
On July 17, 2007, flammable VM&P naphtha was being 
transferred from a tank truck to a vertical 15,000 gallon (57 
m3) above -ground storage tank. After the tank farm 
supervisor started the transfer of the last compartment of a 
tanker -trailer the storage tank exploded. Additional tanks 
exploded and others were set ablaze by the pool of burning 
solvents. The nearby town was evacuated and the entire 
tank farm was destroyed. An employee and a firefighter 
were injured.
While the tanker and storage tank were grounded and the 
tank was bottom -filled, the float -style level gauge was not 
continuously grounded due to the rocking caused by 
turbulence in the tank. (Source: CSB Report No. 2007 -06-
I-KS and video)
On October 29,2007, an operator placed a short nozzle on 
the fill hose into a fill opening on top of the metal 
intermediate bulk container (IBC) and suspended a steel 
weight on the nozzle to keep it in place. The valve was 
opened to fill the IBC, then the operator walked across the 
room. A short time later, he heard a “popping” sound and 
saw the IBC engulfed in flames and the fill nozzle laying on 
the floor discharging ethyl acetate. The IBC was grounded, 
but flow through the non -conductive hose generated static, 
and top -filling caused excess vapors that was ignited 
outside the IBC by a static discharge between the IBC and 
the steel weight. (Source: CSB Report No. 2008 -02-I-IA) "

Relief devices need to vent to a safe location. Verify that the locations are actually safe.1. Relief devices, whether used in process or utility service 
need to vent to a safe location. That can vary by the 
material being relieved. 
2. Poorly sealed manways can release hazardous materials 
and expose workers in the process area. The relief device 
should be the only release point for overpressure.
3. Potential emissions from relief devices should be known 
and documented as critical safety and environmental  data.
4. The safe location for a relief discharge needs to be in an 
area where volatile materials can disperse to the 
atmosphere or where liquids can be contained.
5. When vented materials collect, they can result in a cloud of 
flammable or toxic materials that could ignite or expose 
worker or the community . 
6. Changes to other processes or equipment in the area need 
to be reviewed for any impacts on the dispersion of relief

On April 12, 2004, a company in Dalton Georgia, USA 
was contracted to make triallyl cyanurate. A runaway 
reaction occurred, and flammable and toxic allyl 
alcohol and allyl chloride were released to the 
atmosphere. Some material was released through a 
poorly sealed manway (Figure 1) and more through 
the rupture disc vent  which discharged near the base 
of the reactor (Figure 2). The release forced the 
evacuation of over 200 families in the surrounding 
community.
One worker received chemical burns and 154 people 
including 15 emergency responders  had to be 
decontaminated and treated for chemical exposure.  
(Sources: CSB report 2004 -09-I-GA. Figures from the 
CSB video “Reactive Hazards”)
Another company in the U.S. received a regulatory 
inspection. They were cited for not venting  process 
relief valves to a safe location. While the vents 
discharged outdoors, the release point was directly 
over an exit from the process building. An employee 
exiting during a relief discharge could have walked 
right into a cloud of process materials. 1. Search for relief device vents during your rounds in the unit. 
When you see one look for:
a. Is it labelled as a relief line ?
b. Could it expose someone?
c. Is there other equipment around it that could trap 
flammable or toxic vapors?
d. If the answer to any of these is “Yes” report it to your 
supervisor.
2. If there are process or relief vents at a low level that could 
expose someone, report these too.
3. Ensure all openings (manways, charge ports, etc.) on 
equipment and piping flanges are properly tightened, so 
systems vent only as designed.
4. During MOC reviews, ask for details of a relief discharge 
location. The relief location needs to allow dispersion of 
gases, vapors and/or capture of liquids. Do not allow your relief device vents to be a hazard

Nitrogen is often a safeguard, but it also has serious hazards.•In the US, nitrogen asphyxiation hazards in industry resulted in 80 
deaths from 1992 to 2002. These incidents occurred in a variety of 
facilities, including industrial plants, laboratories, and medical 
facilities; almost half involved contractors. More recently, fourteen 
workers in the US, died from asphyxiation linked to nitrogen 
accidents from 2012 to 2020, according to AP news agency.
•Nitrogen is sometimes called “the silent killer” because it is odorless, 
colorless, tasteless and gives no warning. People in a nitrogen 
enriched environment (low in oxygen) simply lose consciousness 
before realizing they are in danger. Low oxygen can be detected only 
with the correct gas detectors..
•In addition to its asphyxiation hazards, liquid nitrogen is extremely 
cold and contact can quickly cause severe frostbite burns.
•Many nitrogen -related fatalities occur when others rush to rescue a 
worker in an oxygen deficient atmosphere. No one should enter a 
potentially oxygen deficient space without proper permits, 
preparation, and breathing apparatus. Did You Know?

A recent event in Gainesville, Georgia, US, involved a 
significant leak of liquid nitrogen. A poultry processing 
plant used liquid nitrogen to quickly freeze chicken 
products. This freezing system had only been in 
operation for 4 -6 weeks before the event. Six workers 
died and 12 others were taken to a hospital.  130 
people had to be evacuated. A maintenance manager 
shut off an external isolation valve, stopping the flow 
ofliquid nitrogen to the process and likely preventing 
further exposures. While the causes are still under 
investigation, it serves as a reminder for us to  
understand the hazards of nitrogen and use extreme 
caution when working in or around nitrogen 
consuming operations.
Many other oxygen deficiency incidents have 
occurred due to nitrogen leaks or purging. Entering a 
confined space with an oxygen deficient atmosphere 
without testing or a proper breathing apparatus is one 
of the most frequent causes of asphyxiations. •Read the SDS for nitrogen to review its hazards and precautions.
•Review the US Chemical Safety Board’s guidance on nitrogen.

Take extra time to review the situation before operating manual valves.•Manual valves may not be operated often and may not 
seal for many reasons such as worn seats, debris blocking 
the sealing surfaces and corrosion.
•There are many configurations for manual valves. If the 
correct position is not obvious, ask.
•Manual valves that are considered safety critical are often 
car-sealed or tagged in a given position. They deserve 
extra caution before operation.
•Line blind can provide a positive shutoff, but in most 
cases, changing position of line blinds can result in some 
leakage until completely resealed. Switching blinds should 
be handled like a line break and using a permit.
•Certain valving operations have a proper order of 
operation; this should be noted in the operating procedure.Figure 3 Line Blind after

Valve position errors can cause serious incidents
In October 2009, a release of over 260,000 gal. ( 984 
cubic m. ) of gasoline from a storage tank led to a major 
explosion, killing 11 including both operators. (Figure 
1).The official report indicated that the operator made a 
mistake in the sequence of valve operations when 
switching from tank filling to tank discharging, using a 
line blind valve (Figures 2 & 3). 
One operator closed Valves A and B, then moved blind 
C from open to closed. The official report did not reach a 
conclusion about exactly what happened next, as the 
operators died in the incident. Shortly after , a different 
operator moved line blind F from closed to open. 
Gasoline began leaking quickly out of the opening in the 
top of the line blind. The manual valve E and the Motor -
Operated Valve (MOV) D were both found in the open 
position after the accident . (Figure 4)
11 people were killed, the fire burned for 11 days and 
the terminal was a total loss

•When changing valve positions, have the procedure and 
the PID or piping diagram with you to ensure correct 
operation. If the procedure or diagram does not match the 
piping in the field. Stop and ask before proceeding. The 
procedure or diagram may have an error.
•If you need to operate a line blind, ensure that  it has been 
properly isolated and is truly safe to move before changing 
its position. 
•If a valve is car -sealed in a position, the procedure should 
note this. If it is not called out specifically, verify you have 
the correct valve before operation.
•When operating any valve, it is important to verify all drains 
and sample taps are closed before operation. If the 
operating procedure calls for a specific order of operation 
for repositioning valves –follow it. 
•If a valving operation is done by 2 or more crews, verify all 
valve positions are correct before proceeding."

June 2021 Combustible dust hazards are everywhere!
• There are five requirements for a dust explosion: 
1. A combustible dust,
2. The dust is suspended,
3. An oxidant,
4. The dust is confined, and
5. An ignition source.
• Combustible dusts are present in many industries or areas of a plant. 
They may be where you do not expect them, like utilities or waste 
handling. Unattended areas may accumulate combustible dust that is 
unseen.
• Dust collectors are a frequent dust explosion source. They trap the 
smallest particles, which have greater explosion potential. They are 
typically equipped with an explosion relief panel to relieve the 
overpressure. (See Figure 2 ). 
• Maintenance or fabrication operations may have combustible metal 
dust present in grinding or polishing operations.
Some dust explosion prevention strategies are: 
1. Do not let dust accumulate. (See Jan -20 Beacon on housekeeping).
2. Reduce dust at the source with effective dust collection systems.
3. Identify and eliminate potential ignition sources. Figure 1 : CSB Dust Explosion chart (source:

The US Chemical Safety Board ( CSB) collected 
data from 105 dust explosion from 2006 through 
2017. The CSB did not review all the incidents 
from that timeframe. The CSB data was then 
categorized into several broad industry types. 
The CSB chart shows that combustible dust 
explosions occur across many industries and 
operations. While the chemical industry has a 
small fraction of the explosions studied, solids 
handling can be anywhere in the product flow 
from raw material receiving to the final product.
Figure 2: Vented dust continues to burn outside of the vessel•Follow the company or unit housekeeping requirements, but if you see 
dust accumulating, report it to your supervisor
•When working near dust collectors, notice where the explosion relief 
panel is located and avoid it if possible. Relief panel should be labeled 
(See Figure 3).
•Areas around relief panels should be free of obstructions such as 
piping or conduit. Other materials should not be stored in the relief 
zone.
•If you handle solids in your area, understand their properties and 
follow the guidance from the Safety Data Sheet and your procedures.
•If you see dust leaking from equipment, report it to your supervisor.

Figure 1 . Oldsmar , Florida water treatment plant
On February 5, 2021, a water treatment plant 
employee in Oldsmar , Florida, noticed that the  
cursor was moving strangely on the control 
computer screen, Initially, there was no 
concern; the plant used remote -access 
software to allow staff to share screens and 
troubleshoot IT issues. The supervisor often 
connected to the operator’s computer to 
monitor the facility's systems too. A few hours 
later, the operator noticed the cursor moving 
and clicking through the water treatment 
plant's controls. Within seconds, the intruder 
was attempting to change the system's 
sodium hydroxide setpoint from 100 parts per 
million (ppm) to 11,100 ppm. The operator 
quickly spotted the intrusion and returned the 
sodium hydroxide to normal levels. 
Fortunately, there was no impact on the water 
quality.
A recent ransomware attack on the Colonial 
Pipeline shut down the supply of gasoline to

August 2021
An incident in DeRidder, Louisiana, on February 
8, 2017, was investigated and reported by the US 
Chemical Safety Board (CSB). The explosion 
occurred in a condensate tank (mostly water but 
containing some organic material) which led to an 
unanticipated flammable atmosphere. 
According to the CSB report, the condensate tank 
failed at its base and traveled approximately 375 
feet, over a six -story building before landing on 
process equipment. There were three fatalities 
from the explosion, and seven people were 
injured.
The source of ignition was probably Hot Work that 
was performed near the tank. The organic 
material in the tank was turpentine, a solvent 
obtained from resin, contained in wood, during 
paper manufacturing. It consists of several 
hydrocarbons and is different from mineral 
turpentine, also called white spirit.
A small quantity of flammable liquid is no small hazard!•Combustible material, a fuel, can form an explosive 
atmosphere when enough of it is dispersed in air. For 
liquids, this dispersion is usually caused by evaporation.
•This explosive atmosphere contains the fuel in a certain 
concentration range, the explosive (or flammable) range. 
Below this there is not enough fuel, above it there is not 
enough oxygen in the mixture. 20 g/m³ , 4 tablespoons 
evaporated in 100 cubic feet, can be sufficient.
•Liquids that are volatile enough to create an explosive 
atmosphere at “normal” temperatures are called flammable 
liquids and are labeled accordingly. Different systems exist 
to define what these “normal” temperatures are. 
•If the temperature of a liquid is high, it forms an explosive 
atmosphere even if it is not labeled flammable!
•In processes that involve water and organic liquids, these 
liquids usually have lower density than water and can float 
on top of it. 
•In bulk tanks, the layer of flammable liquid can vaporize to 
create an explosive atmosphere in the tank’s vapor space 
(Figure 1).
•Tanks are often protected from over pressure or vacuum 
with a “breather vent”. These vents can allow air to enter 
the tank when draining it or vapor to escape when filling.
•Some companies inert bulk tanks containing flammable 
liquids to prevent ignition of the contents.Did You Know?

•Know the properties of the materials used in your area. Pay 
special attention to tanks that may have two or more 
phases (layers) in them.
•Wastewater tanks can have a flammable phase that 
accumulates over time. These tanks may need to be 
treated as if they contained a flammable material.
•Inspect the inerting systems on your tanks and verify they 
are operating properly.
•During Hot Work around tanks with flammable or 
combustible contents, be vigilant and follow the company’s 
Hot Work procedure (ref. Aug -20 Beacon).Explosion of a tank containing “mostly water”

Does your nose really know? Probably not !
What happened? On June 9, 2009, a natural gas 
explosion damaged a meat processing factory in 
Garner, North Carolina. Three workers were killed 
when a section of the building collapsed. Four workers 
were critically burned, and 71 persons were sent to the 
hospital. Three firefighters were exposed to toxic 
anhydrous ammonia from the plant’s refrigeration 
system. About 18,000 lbs(8165 kg) of ammonia were 
released and a large area of the plant was damaged. 
What went wrong? While installing a new gas -fired 
water heater in a utility room ,a worker from the water 
heater manufacturer was attempting to displace the air 
in the new gas line using natural gas. The purged fuel 
gas vented into the utility room. An exhaust fan 
provided some ventilation, but a combustible gas 
detector was not used to monitor the area. Personnel 
relied on their sense of smell to determine when the 
piping had been effectively purged of air. 
What was missed? Some  nearby employees smelled 
gas; others did not smell it. Personnel who noticed the 
gas odor were not concerned ,thinking this was a 
normal part of  starting the water heater. Manufacturer 
and company employees were not aware that the 
purging created a dangerous accumulation of natural 
gas in the utility room that exceeded the lower 
explosive limit (LEL). The utility room contained 
several potential ignition sources, including 
unclassified electrical devices, that could have ignited 
the gas.
Use the correct gas meter ! Do not rely on your sense of smell to detect hazardous gases. The ability to smell some gases fades when workers are 
exposed for some time. This is true of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) 
and the mercaptans used to odorize natural gas.
The natural ability of individuals to detect certain odors varies 
widely and is affected by respiratory factors like having a cold 
the flu or Covid .
Workers repeatedly exposed to chemicals experience a loss 
in odor detection ability due to odor adaptability and olfactory 
fatigue.
The U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health 
(NIOSH) released a bulletin about odorant fade. (link: 
https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2021 -106/)
Flammable vapors or gases vented into a confined or 
congested area can accumulate and form a flammable gas 
cloud.
Portable gas meters are the best method to detect and 
monitor the level of hazardous gases. Use the correct meter 
for the gas present in the area and calibrate gas meters 
before each use. 
Intermittent gas testing can detect a gas leak. However, 
continuous gas testing is the best way to monitor an area for 
hazardous gases. 
Never rely on the sense of smell to detect hazardous gases 
–it is unreliable. If you do smell a hazardous gas, leave the 
area and notify your supervisor immediately.
If hazardous gas purging is required, follow the purging 
procedure carefully. Verify that the hazardous gases are 
vented to a well -ventilated area.
Before breaking or opening a line containing hazardous gas, 
conduct a hazard review or use the proper permit to ensure 
all required safety systems are used.
Before using a gas meter, verify it has been calibrated by a 
competent person for the gas of interest and it is used 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Did You Know?

OCTOBER 2021 How do you know your safety devices are working?
• Active safety devices such as alarms, interlocks, or 
shutdown systems must be tested on a schedule, or 
reliability deteriorates over time (Fig. 4). This is 
particularly true of gas detectors which are sensitive 
instruments that require regular calibration. 
• Most safety devices are not called on to function during 
normal operation of your plant. If they are not working 
because of component failure or an operational error 
such as disabling them, the failure is hidden.
• A robust reliability program tests all components as a 
system to confirm that the entire system will work when 
needed. Inspection, testing, and maintenance frequency 
and procedures are established by your plant engineers 
based on reliability calculations and failure data.
• Results of inspection, testing, and maintenance activities 
for safety devices must be documented.
• Test results should be reviewed to identify chronic 
failure issues, and to confirm that component failure 
rates are consistent with the designer’s assumptions. Did You Know?This issue sponsored by

In October 2019, a  lone -worker employee responded to a pump oil 
level alarm at an unmanned waterflood station in Texas. A 
waterflood station pumps water separated from crude oil back into 
the underground oil formation to improve extraction. The employee 
isolated the pump by closing valves but did not perform Lockout / 
Tagout. At some point, the pump automatically started, and water 
known to  contain hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a toxic gas, was released. 
The employee died from exposure to H2S. The tragedy was 
compounded when the employee’s wife searched for him and went 
into the waterflood station. She was also exposed to H2S and died.
There were many failures in process safety management systems 
which contributed to this incident. This Beacon will focus on on e of 
the contributing causes –the failure of the H2S  alarm system. The 
waterflood station was equipped with an H2S detection and alarm 
system. However, the alarm panel did not receive a signal from the 
indoor or outside detect ors (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). Therefore, the H2S 
alarm warning light (Fig. 2) was not activated. Some detectors were 
set in test mode, which prevented them from sending an alarm 
signal. Other detectors were correctly set up, but the signals were 
not received by the alarm panel. Investigators were unable to find 
any maintenance, testing, or calibration records for the H2S 
detection and alarm system.
Inspect and test your safety systems to be sure they work!What Can You Do?
Fig. 1: One of the
H2S detectorsFig. 2: H2S alarm warning light
• If you are involved in inspecting and testing safety 
alarms, interlocks, and other safety devices, always 
follow procedures rigorously, and document the results.
• Use written checklists and procedures to ensure that 
required tests are properly done.
• Always remember to put the safety device back online 
when inspection and testing are complete.
• Know where to find the results of safety device tests. If 
you find that the required tests have not been done or 
documented, report your observations to management.
• If you are aware of safety devices that do not have 
inspection and testing programs, report this to 
management.

Twenty years ago, a group of CCPS -member 
company representatives met and determined that a 
new process safety tool was needed. That tool was 
meant for frontline employees –mainly operations 
and maintenance personnel. The outcome was the 
CCPS Process Safety Beacon. From the first edition 
in November of 2001 as a text document, the 
committee has published it monthly and it is now 
emailed to over 30,000  subscribers. The readership 
has grown from a few hundred to an estimated 1 
million. 
The Beacon is intended to provide a process safety 
message for frontline employees that can be shared, 
posted on bulletin boards, used in toolbox meetings 
and for safety moments to remind people about  
process safety topics.

December 2021 Situational Awareness: A key to avoiding errors
Two operators were sent to change valve 
positions and bring a pump on -line. When the 
valve would not open, the operators decided to 
remove the gearbox to access the valve stem 
directly and open the valve with a wrench. This 
activity could be done without affecting the valve 
top cap on most valves of this type. However, 
this valve was a different model. When the 
operators removed the gearbox from this valve, 
the operators also removed the mounting bolts 
that secured the valve top cap. 
When the valve was opened manually, a large 
vapor leak occurred, ignited, and caused 
serious damage. 
Situational Awareness: Check Before You Act Situational awareness is recognizing where you 
are and what is needed to perform the task safely. 
Inadequate situational awareness is a major factor 
in accidents caused by human error. 
Having several configurations for equipment in an 
area or unit can be confusing and create an error 
trap –making it easier for someone to make a 
mistake.
Having a second person to observe the operation 
is sometimes called the ‘4 -Eyes Principle.’ 
However, this practice improves safety only if the 
observer knows how to perform the task andis 
willing to intervene if an error is made or an unsafe 
situation develops. 
Prepare for an activity by reading the procedure 
BEFORE going to the field.
Take two minutes before doing the task to ask 
yourself “ What could go wrong?” , to review/check 
if you have the procedure, PPE and equipment 
needed to perform the job safely. 
If you observe an error trap, notify your supervisor 
and file a safety report.
If an error trap cannot be corrected quickly, tag the 
device to alert others.
Make sure all valve positions, the status of the 
equipment, and expected process conditions are 
identified in task procedures to reduce errors.
If asked to perform a task that you haven’t done in 
a while, review the procedures and ask a coworker 
if anything has changed.Figure 1: Diagram showing correct and incorrect ways to

•The plant had been running for many years before 
process safety regulations required accurate P&IDs, or 
operating procedures. Management of Change (MOC) 
was not used as rigorously as it is today.
•If your process was built before process safety regulations 
came into effect, you may have similar error traps lurking 
about.
•Operating Procedures must be up to date and must be 
followed exactly. Errors in procedures should be 
corrected.
•Operating Procedures should be well written and  
describe the process steps  in a safe manner, to protect 
you, your company, and the community.
•Hazards of overfill were discussed in two Process Hazard 
Analysis (PHA) studies before the incident occurred. 
Credit was taken for the HiHi level interlock. It appears 
the operators never mentioned the “emergency power 
supply”. It wasn’t marked on the drawings, nor 
mentioned in the operating procedures which hid this 
weakness from the hazard review teams.
•All changes that can affect the process –including 
temporary power supplies –need to go through MOC.
•Safety interlocks should not be used to routinely stop the 
filling of a tank. The operating procedures should identify 
the normal point to stop filling.On October 11, 2008, an overfill of oleum (a solution of sulfur 
trioxide in sulfuric acid) put a cloud of toxic and corrosive  
SO3/H2SO4 mist across three towns in Pennsylvania. About 2500 
people had to evacuate or shelter -in-place. Fortunately, no serious 
injuries occurred. 
Originally , the facility was built with one power supply and three 
plug -in pumps. This prevented more than one pump being used at a 
time. To prevent an overfill, this power supply was interlocked to 
stop the pump on a High -High (HiHi) level in either tank 1501 or 
1502. However, in the 1980’s, a “temporary” emergency power 
supply was added after several power outages in  the main/normal 
system. This emergency system was never added to the Piping and 
Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), nor to the operating procedures. 
Importantly, it was NOT controlled by the HiHi level interlock. 
On the day of the overflow, an operator was called in and began to 
pump oleum from Tank 610 to Tank 1502. To save time, he also 
began a transfer from Tank 611 to Tank 1502 by plugging  another 
pump into the emergency power supply. This practice had been 
passed from operator to operator for many years, but it was not 
documented nor managed within the Process Safety Program. The 
HiHi Level switch was unable to stop the transfer from tank 611 and 
tank 1502 overfilled, releasing oleum.
Drawings and procedures need to be accurate , up-to-date, & followed ! •During  Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) meetings, look 
carefully at the drawings. If they don’t match what is in 
the field or if something is missing, point that out.
•All “undocumented practices” need to be pointed out to 
the supervisor. These practices must be written down, 
checked, and approved. 
•Follow your procedures. If they aren’t complete –or 
don’t match your current practices –get someone to 
review and correct them. 
•Beware of minor changes to the process. These should go 
through the Management of Change (MOC) procedure .Fig. 1  Schematic of the oleum transfer system (see reference below)

February  2022 Piping Dead Legs –Another hazard in plain sight! 
Dead Legs can be very alive. Never assume that abandoned piping is not corroding.Did You Know?This issue sponsored by
Messages for Manufacturing Personnel
www.aiche.org/ccps/process -safety -beacon  
What Happened?
At a refining site, an x -ray examination 
was done on a 2” drain line connected 
to a 12” crude line. The x -ray showed 
deep pits beneath deposits of process 
material in a horizontal section of the 
drain line. Further inspection of other 
locations identified more areas with 
significant internal corrosion. These 
were typical cases of Dead Leg 
Corrosion. The Dead Leg Inspection in 
this case certainly prevented a Loss of 
Containment Incident.
Various dead leg piping configurations 
can form dead legs as shown in Fig. 1. 
The Beacon Committee would like to 
thanks Reliance Industries LTD. For 
providing the material for this Beacon .
Source for the Fig1: Linkedin article by 
Mohammed Said Mechanical Integrity & Hazard 
Identification of Dead LegCorrosion in dead legs represents a significant threat to the integrity of 
process and utility piping. 
Dead legs can be left from initial piping installation when they were used for 
flushing, draining or pressure testing. They should have been removed 
before commissioning.
Dead legs that contain potentially corrosive materials such as contaminated 
water, or deposits of solid materials require focused inspection attention. 
Even gases like H2S can be corrosive. 
Piping that was flushed and drained may still contain hazardous materials. 
Opening these lines should require the same caution as if they were full. 
What Can You Do?
Dead legs should beidentified and besubjected toaregular review to
decide ifthey arestill needed .Those that arenotused should beremoved
following theManagement ofChange (MOC) procedures .
The facility should have program formanaging dead legs.The program
should include :
o Aschedule forperiodic flushing ofdead legs
o Inspection plan based ontheanticipated corrosion rates
o Review dead leg inspection results during Process Hazard and MOC

www.aiche.org/ccps/process -safety -beacon  
Hot Work is more than Welding, Burning & Grinding March 2022
Did You Know?
•Welding, flame -cutting and grinding are well -known 
Hot Work hazards, because they can be “spark -
scattering” activities sending sparks a long way. 
•Many other tools  -like electrical tools or even some 
hand tools -also produce more localized ignition 
hazards either from heat or from sparks from the 
motor brushes. As battery -powered tools become 
more powerful and more common, they represent 
an increasing ignition hazard.
•Electronic devices being used (e.g. cameras, test 
equipment, tablets) need to be certified for use in 
classified areas.
•All these hazards can be managed using well -
planned Hot Work and safe work reviews before 
issuing permits.
•Sometimes, contractors bring other hazards with 
their tools or construction materials. 
•Even a fire that does not injure or kill people can 
cost a company a lot of money due to the damage 
and  business interruption. 
•Confined Space Work is one of the highest hazard 
activities in our industry. Many people have been 
hurt or killed during those activities.
•If you issue or oversee work permit systems, make 
sure you understand the work contractors will be 
doing, and the methods, materials and tools they 
will be using. 
•The permit issuer is responsible to protect 
contractors from the hazards of the processes. But 
the issuer must also recognize any hazards that 
contractors bring with them and protect company 
facilities from those hazards. 
•Emphasize to the workers that if anything in the 
original plan changes –they must check back with 
the issuer to see if the permit and the precautions 
need to be updated.What Can You Do?

Fig. 3: Columns
size comparison addedOn September 21, 2020, a fire (Fig. 2) 
was ignited in a bucket of flammable 
resin being used to reline a Fiberglass 
Reinforced Plastic (FRP) tower at a 
papermill. Smoke and fumes from the 
fire killed two contractors. There are 
many lessons to be learned from this 
event. This Beacon will focus on the 
uncontrolled Hot Work aspect of the 
incident.
The plant was shut down for a 
turnaround, including internal repairs 
to the Upflow and Downflow bleaching 
columns (Fig. 3). 
The repairs to these were managed under two Confined Space 
Entry (CSE) Permits.  Hot Work was not planned, nor authorized 
for either job. There were no flammable materials in the towers, 
though the FRP walls in the Upflow Tower were combustible. 
On the day of the fire, the crew working in the Upflow Tower 
(left) were having difficulty getting their resin to cure properly, 
due to cool temperatures. When they found no drum heaters for 
the drum outside the tower, they decided to use a heat gun (Fig. 
1) for the bucket at their working place ( marked red ). 
The heat gun was accidentally dropped into a resin bucket, 
igniting the flammable contents. The crew didn’t have a fire 
extinguisher, and the fire spread –eventually igniting the FRP 
walls. Two contractors working in the connected Downflow 
Tower ( right; marked green ) were overcome by the gases before 
they could escape.

April 2022
On July 12, 2020, a fire broke out on the US Navy ship USS 
Bonhomme Richard while it was docked in San Diego, 
California. The fire burned for 5 days and spread to 11 of the 
15 decks of the ship. Temperatures from the fire exceeded 
1400 °F (760 °C). The financial loss was more than 3 billion 
dollars, and the ship was decommissioned. 
Following the fire, the US Navy conducted a study of 15 fires 
which had occurred in ships over a 12 -year period prior to the 
Bonhomme Richard fire. This study identified multiple 
recurring causal factors, both in how the fires started, and how 
they escalated. Several of the causal factors in the Navy ship 
fires are also potential causes for a fire, or for a fire to grow 
into a more severe incident, in the process industries.
Reference: “Major Fires Review Executive Summary, Commander, U. S. Fleet Forces

https:// www.documentcloud.org/documents/21089015 -for-release -major -fires -
review -19-oct-21Some findings from the US Navy investigation which are relevant 
to process industry plants include :
Unauthorized materials were brought onto the ship.
Combustible and hazardous materials were handled and 
stored improperly.
Procedures were not followed,  and inspection programs 
were ineffective.
Excessive amounts of combustible and hazardous materials 
were stored in portable containers with no recognition of 
the fire risk.
There was no comprehensive review, approval or oversight 
of hot work, and there was no temporary fire protection or 
fire response plan in place.
Personnel were not proficient in the use of fire detection 
and suppression systems and emergency communications 
equipment .
If your plant handles flammable, combustible, or other 
hazardous materials in portable containers, always store the 
containers in properly designated areas which are compliant 
with regulations and standards for storage of those 
materials.
Return unused material in containers to designated storage 
areas immediately when you determine they are no longer 
needed in the production area.
Rigorously follow your plant procedures for hot work and 
other work which requires a permit.
Review other Beacons which discuss hot work (6/2018, 
5/2020, 8/2020, 8/2021, 3/2022, search www.aiche.org for 
“Beacon”).
Participate in emergency drills and report any issues you 
observe during the drills so that emergency procedures can 
be improved. 
If your plant has not had an emergency drill recently suggest 
that one be conducted.
Skim through the referenced US Navy report and look for 
other lessons relevant to your plant. "

Batch processes can have many manual operations which 
increase the possibility for human errors.
Chemicals are often supplied and stored in similar 
containers. Labelling of those containers is the primary 
safeguard to prevent a mistake. (see January 2021 Beacon 
“Material identification –the first link in the process safety 
system” )
Many hazard review methods require a review of past 
incidents with that process. Past events reveal weaknesses 
that may be present if safeguards are not working well. 
Companies need to conduct thorough process hazard 
reviews that include evaluating potential human errors and 
error traps. Asking “What if ? “ or “What happens if ?”  are 
important to protect workers, the environment, and the 
company.
Blending operations are usually simple mixing procedures 
with no intended chemical reaction. However, reactions can 
be caused by possible contamination, wrong material or 
material that is added at the wrong time/step.
Tanks and mixing vessels should be closed, sealed and 
vented to a safe location when in operation to prevent spills 
and chemical exposures.Post-explosion photo of the AB Specialty Silicones

On May 3, 2019, operators at a plant in Waukegan, Illinois were 
performing a batch operation, manually adding and mixing 
chemicals in a tank inside a building. An operator pumped an 
incorrect chemical into the tank. That chemical was incompatible 
with a chemical already in the tank. After the chemicals were 
mixed; they reacted. The tank contents foamed and overflowed 
from the tank top opening. The reaction produced highly 
flammable hydrogen gas which was released into the building. The 
hydrogen ignited, and the explosion destroyed the building, fatally 
injuring four employees. 
The incompatible chemical was stored in a 55 -gallon blue plastic 
drum identical to drums containing the correct chemicals. The only 
differentiating markings were small labels on the drums and bung 
caps. The company did not have a written procedure requiring 
employees to segregate incompatible chemicals in the production 
building or to remove containers after use. In March 2019, two 
months before this incident, this company had a near -miss 
involving two chemicals stored in similar 55 -gallon blue metal 
drums. The wrong material was added to a batch from similar 
drums. To avoid confusion from similar containers, it developed a 
procedure for 2 people to verify material identity prior to addition.
This company assessed product manufacturing operations using a 
“Technical Service Request” (TSR), which evaluated business and 
safety risks. The TSR did not, and was not intended to, assess 
hazards of process operations or to establish safeguards.
During the incident, workers recognized that a process upset had 
occurred when the tank overflowed, and a fog formed. However, 
the workers did not recognize the immediate hydrogen hazard 
created by the upset which was noted on the Safety Data Sheet 
(SDS) for the input material.When participating in hazard reviews, be honest about 
possible errors that could occur and errors that have
occurred. Even those that seem minor.
Hazard reviews need to evaluate possible reactions even if 
the process is not designed to have reactions. 
The best way to evaluate possible reactivity issues is to 
conduct a reactivity review using the unit’s 
reactivity/compatibility matrix. If you are not aware of this 
matrix, ask your supervisor if a copy is available.
(See the July 2016 Beacon for details on such matrices.)
The best way to stay alert and involved in a hazard review is 
to actively participate, by both asking questions and 
listening to the responses.
When asked, d ouble -check tasks or materials rigorously 
and in person.
Sometimes, we need to think the “unthinkable.”"

A company decided to stop making a chemical product. One 
of the input materials was toxic and corrosive phosphorus 
trichloride (PCl3). The lines to the storage tank and the 
process area were cleared of PCl3. A few years later, an 
operator found a leak outdoors. The investigation found that 
the leak was coming from the “empty” PCl3line. No one was 
injured and the spill was contained.
During the clearing and flushing steps to shut down the PCl3
facility, someone missed clearing or flushing that section of 
line. It took a while, but the material corroded the “empty” 
pipe and caused a release. 
We think of catastrophic incidents as occurring quickly like an 
explosion. However, many serious incidents have occurred 
months or even years after a mistake was made.
An operator may have mistakenly opened the wrong valve, 
realized the mistake ,closed it, but never told anyone. Did 
some material pass through in that short time? What 
happens or when it will occur is difficult to predict, but it 
could cause a serious problem.
Or take another example: A maintenance technician is 
replacing the seal on a pump. The wrong seal is picked up in 
the stockroom and  installed. When put into service, it may 
take some more time for the incorrect seal to fail. The 
incorrect seal will probably fail before the correct one.We are human; we make mistakes. Even highly trained 
people like pilots and astronauts make mistakes!
There are two kinds of mistakes: 
 Not taking the required action or doing it at the 
wrong time (error of omission). 
 Knowing the correct thing to do but choosing to 
do something different (error of commission). 
Safety barriers prevent process safety incidents. It may 
take time for all the barriers to fail, then an incident 
occurs. 
However, before then, there may be warning signs of 
failed barriers –noises, odors, drips, etc. Watching for 
and responding to those warning signs is how to prevent 
the major incidents.Did You Know?

When performing a task, no matter how simple, follow 
the directions and steps. If there are conflicts or errors, 
report them to your supervisor.
If you make a mistake when performing your tasks, 
report it. Better to be slightly embarrassed than to have 
someone get injured.
Watch for warning signs. Review, for instance, the 
Beacons of September 2012, ”What can I do? I’m just 
the operator”, and December 2015, “Stop! Look! 
Listen!”.
When others make mistakes, make the effort to 
understand their errors so you can learn from them. 
When discussing others’ mistakes, do not focus on 
blame, focus solely on lessons learned and process 
improvement.  Blaming degrades process safety 
culture. It deters others from reporting problems, near 
misses, errors, and mistakes that may develop into 
severe events at some later time.
An error now may cause a disaster in the future !"

A plant experienced a piping leak and could not 
shutdown to properly repair it. Using their leak 
clamp procedure, they consulted the required 
experts and approved use of a temporary clamp 
for 6 months. After that time, the status of the 
clamp was to be reviewed, evaluated and if 
acceptable, reapproved by the proper people. 
Two years later this clamp started to leak. The 
reevaluations and reapprovals had not taken 
place and the clamp remained in service for 
much longer than allowed by the company’s 
policies and procedures. 
A pipe clamp is a temporary solution when 
proper repairs cannot be made. It is weaker than 
the original piping. Besides, the underlying 
problem that led to the first leak is still there. It 
has to be fixed eventually. Pipe clamps are not 
meant to be “permanent” solutions. 
All temporary changes need to be managed 
under the company’s Management of Change 
process. And best practice is to enter a 
“turnaround” type work -order so maintenance 
can plan to repair/replace the leaking pipe at the 
next turnaround. 
Temporary means TemporaryPipe clamps are one of several types of Engineered 
clamp -on leak -sealing devices. They place a pressure -
envelope around the location of the leak, then use 
pumped -in polymers to fill their internal space and seal up 
any gaps. They are effective temporary ways to stop a 
leak.
All changes to a hazardous process should be reviewed, 
approved and managed under your site’s Management of 
Change (MOC) process. 
Pipe clamps are not intended to last forever. Eventually, 
the pipe or valve should be replaced with one built to 
conform to the original pipe specification.  
It is easy to lose track of a temporary repair like a pipe 
clamp even though it can be seen. 
The goal of asset integrity systems is to maintain the 
reliability of the process equipment. When these systems 
are not followed, the equipment reliability declines, and 
safety is compromised.
A by-passed control loop or device may not be as obvious.
When you see a temporary repair, ask your supervisor 
about it. Your question may point out an overdue review 
or inspection.
Each temporary repair should have an approved 
temporary MOC associated with it. Temporary MOCs 
must be managed rigorously –including a regular check 
and re -authorization until it can be replaced at the next 
turnaround with a permanent solution. 
Various components of the process can be temporarily by -
passed for inspection or calibration. If you see this during 
your rounds, point it out to your supervisor. Do not change 
this unless you have been authorized.
Control systems that are by -passed can be more difficult 
to find. Some control systems can list which control loops 
are in by -pass, are deactivated or are out of service. Figure 1. A temporary Pipe clamp over a valve that

A tank exploded as it was being emptied using a 
vacuum truck with a non -conductive hose. Four 
contractors were killed and a fifth experienced life -
altering injuries. The company and the contractors 
were fined more than 8 million USD, and plant 
operations were interrupted for weeks. 
The workers had not expected to find flammable 
vapor in the tank. Due to a process change about 10 
years before the incident, flammable liquid 
hydrocarbons could slowly accumulate on top of the 
liquid in the tank. There were several incidents that 
warned of  flammable materials in the tank. 
There were several causes for this accident but  
focus this month on just one. The operator took a 
“gas reading” inside the tank’s vapor -space as he 
prepared the work permit; he got a reading of 67% of 
the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) inside, near the top 
of the tank. (see Table 1) It’s not clear why, but the 
work continued despite the high reading . The 
ignition source for the explosion was electrostatic 
spark and self -ignition of pyrophoric material; 
neither were recognized when preparing for the 
work.
An LEL reading means there is some flammable vapor Several regulators, including US OSHA, prohibit a confined 
space permit being issued if the concentration of flammable 
vapors is above 10% of the LEL.
Many flammable vapors are heavier than air, so they can be 
more concentrated at the lowest point –near the bottom of 
the tanks, in sumps or trenches.
Sludge in the bottom of a tank may contain pockets of 
flammables. These can be released as the sludge is 
disturbed and cleaned out. 
The movement of  fluids –even of solids -through hoses can 
generate static charge. It’s important to bond and ground all 
equipment in or near hazardous locations.
Perform the gas tests thoroughly by using a properly 
calibrated LEL meter and following your procedure for LEL 
testing.
A reading above the limits in the LEL testing procedure, 
means that something is wrong. Do not proceed until the 
problem is fixed and you get acceptable readings. 
See Beacons from August 2020 about where to test for 
flammables, and the March 2020 on vacuum truck hazards .
Your site should follow good engineering practices for tank 
cleaning, like Energy Institute Part 16 “Tank Cleaning Safety 
Code” or API 2015 “Safe Entry and Cleaning of Petroleum 
Storage Tanks”.Figure 1. Aftermath of the explosion and fire Did You Know?

Lightning Strikes –YIKES!!
Take precautions against static sparks –especially lightning.Static sparks can occur whenever there is friction between 
materials during material movement, such as transfer.
Grounding and bonding can help dissipate an electric 
charge. To work, they need to be in good condition, be in 
good contact with the metal container, and be connected 
to a proper ground.
Lightning is a massive spark that is created when water 
droplets, dust, or ice particles move around a cloud,
generating static electricity.
Lightning can strike anywhere -it is just not safe to work 
outdoors in an electrical storm.
An electrical current can travel through connected 
equipment and cause an incident far away from where the 
lightning actually struck.

•Be sure to always ground and bond flammable 
containers. This includes pails, drums, isotainers, trucks 
rail cars, and also storage tanks. 
•Make sure that grounding clamp sbite into the metal to 
get good contact. If a clamp cannot “bite into the metal,” 
replace the clamp. 
•Report if a connection point is painted; the paint could 
prevent the good contact with the grounding clamp 
needed to dissipate the accumulated static.
•If you see that a grounding wire is frayed, corroded, not 
attached, etc., report it.  That grounding cable cannot
prevent ignition of a flammable  container or storage tank 
in the event of a lightning strike or other stray electrical 
current.
•Lightning is unpredictable and can damage even 
grounded equipment. If you are doing a transfer and a 
storm comes, stop the transfer, and leave the area until 
you are given  approval to safely resume operations.In the early morning hours of May 16, 2012, a 
thunderstorm rolled into a Bristol, Pennsylvania 
plant that produced acrylic polymers. Lightning 
struck in the tank farm area. Within seconds, an 
ethyl acrylate tank exploded and was followed a 
few minutes later by a butyl acrylate tank 
explosion. The explosions and ensuing fires 
destroyed the two tanks and led to a lengthy 
shutdown. Two people were in the area of the tank 
farm doing paperwork during the lightning strike; 
fortunately, there were no injuries.
The tanks were grounded according to industry 
lightning standards, so why did the explosion 
occur? While it could not be determined with 
certainty, the ignition of the atmosphere in the 
ethyl acrylate tank most likely occurred because an 
internal component was not bonded to the tank. A 
spark may have occurred across a small gap and 
ignited the flammable vapor, similar to the way a 
spark plug ignites fuel in a combustion engine.

If you are  not sure if equipment is ready after maintenance –ASK!!Many safety systems we use today are the result of incidents 
that occurred in the past. They are intended to prevent those 
errors from recurring.
Communication is always important, but even more so when 
several work groups are involved. As the number of groups 
increase, the need for formal communication also increases.
Many companies use a work permit system to ensure 
communication before, during, and after the approved work. It 
usually includes a safety or hazard review, work area  
inspection, and approval by an authorized person. 
Work permits are not just a formality; they are a tool to ensure 
the work scope is well defined, all groups know what will be 
done, and that any additional permits (LOTO, hot work or 
confined space) are used properly. They also provide a way to 
verify all actions are properly completed and the work can 
proceed safely.
The scope of work can change as the work progresses. It is 
important for all groups to communicate changes and evaluate if 
it is safe to continue work. This may mean shutting the work 
down until it can be reviewed, and a revised work plan is 
developed and approved.Figure 1.Flowmeter ready for calibrationDid You Know?

An inexperienced operator was running a process that 
involved regular transfers of flammable solvents. Part 
of the operation was shut down to allow a 
maintenance technician to remove a flow meter for 
repair and calibration in the shop. The rest of the 
operation continued. The meter was reinstalled, and 
the maintenance person left the area. The operator 
assumed that it was ready for operation and began a 
solvent transfer. One flange was not properly 
tightened, and the operator was sprayed with solvent. 
He used the safety shower and was not injured. The 
solvent spill was cleaned up without incident.
Why did this happen? Many of the process safety 
systems we use now were not yet in place. Lockout -
Tagout (LOTO) was very informal and used only tags 
vs. locks and tags. There was no work permit system 
or formal communication method for maintenance 
work.
Deeper review shows that the operator may have 
been anxious to get the process back in operation and 
didn’t verify that the work was complete. Perhaps the 
technician needed another gasket. The maintenance 
technician did not communicate with the operator 
about the status before leaving the process area. The 
absence of a tag on the solvent isolation valve was 
interpreted as ‘work complete’. Develop a good understanding of how your company’s permit 
systems work. 
Actively participate in hazard reviews for permit -required work. 
You may be the only one there who knows about a particular 
situation or hazard. 
•Know your role during periods of non -standard work in your 
area—understand the work and what is necessary to resume 
normal operation.
•Follow the work plan to restart the process. If something  is not 
correct, stop and ask before proceeding. A minor delay  is much 
better than an incident or near -miss. 
•Make sure that the area is cleared of work debris and tools so 
the process can be safely operated. Process materials or 
equipment debris are proper labeled for disposal.Communication –the heart of safe operations

Make sure your operations remain safe during the holidays.  What Can You Do?
At 2:46 AM, November 22, 2006, a violent explosion occurred in 
Danvers, Massachusetts. The explosion destroyed the ink and 
paint manufacturing facility (Figure 1) and destroyed or damaged 
nearby homes and businesses and shattered windows as far away 
as two miles (3.2km). On November 21, at about 1 PM, employees 
began mixing a 2000 -gallon batch containing flammable solvents. 
The production manager opened the steam valve at about 3 PM to 
begin heating the mixture to 90 °F (32 °C). At 5 PM. the production 
manager returned and found mixture at about 90 °F and left the 
mixer on to prevent undissolved resin from settling. At 6 PM, the 
last employee turned off the dust collector fans, exhaust fans, and 
fresh air supply fan, locked the building and left for the night. 
Flammable vapors escaped from the tank as it continued to heat 
and accumulated in the building due to the inactive ventilation 
systems. At 2:46 AM, the explosion occurred, Officials ordered an 
evacuation of about 300 residents and 10 businesses within the 
incident area . (Ref. CSB Report N. 2007 -03-I-MA, May 2008 
The end of the year brings holidays to many parts of the world. 
Units or parts of operations may be shut down to reduce 
inventories or allow employees time off. This could mean a unit 
may not be in operation, but still hold hazardous materials like the 
tank in this incident. Process materials remain hazardous when stored 
even in the correct process equipment.
Equipment that is shut down or idled still needs to be 
monitored and alarms need to be addressed, 
Reactive materials held in process equipment may 
continue to react even below the specified reaction 
temperatures. They should be stored where they are 
safest. 
Conditions can change during a shutdown. Valves can 
leak or process drains can be left open. 
Plants may use idle time to conduct maintenance 
which can also cause changes to equipment or 
process conditions. 
When employees take vacation to celebrate holidays, 
crew size may be reduced and people may be 
performing tasks they have not done in a while.
The “holiday atmosphere” can be a distraction to those 
who are running the plant.
When equipment is shut down or idle, continue to 
monitor process data and alarms. 
Field rounds should be conducted with the same 
diligence as when the unit is in full operation to make 
sure things remain in a safe condition. 
If process materials are left in the equipment, the 
material and the inventory should be noted in the shift 
logbook. 
Double -check that drains and vents opened when 
emptying equipment are closed and all caps and 
plugs are reinstalled. 
If crew assignments require you to do a task that you 
haven’t performed in a while, take extra time to read 
the procedure thoroughly. Watch for steps or PPE 
requirements that may have changed since you last 
did that task. 
Do not allow yourself or others to be distracted by 
holiday activities. Stay focused on your work and 
celebrate later.

Safety is the best gift for the holidays. Bodhi Day, Boxing Day, Christmas, Gita Jayanti, 
Hannukah, Kwanzaa, New Year, and Ōmisoka are 
some of the many holidays that are celebrated at 
the end of the calendar year. Often, employees 
take vacation time to spend them with their 
families; holidays may involve exchanging gifts 
with family & friends. 
As the holidays approach, we can become very 
busy with preparations –buying gifts, cooking, 
cleaning and decorating. It is important not to let 
the excitement of the holidays overtake the safety 
of our family, friends and homes. 
The risk of house
fires increases 
during the holidays
Don’t let this
Become this
The National Fire Protection Association reports more than 
770 home fires are caused by holiday decorations every 
year. 
Electrical wiring or lighting equipment was involved in 
almost half of home holiday tree fires. Nearly 20% of 
holiday tree fires were started by decorative lights.
(ref. https:// www.nfpa.org/Public -Education/Fire -causes -and-
risks/Seasonal -fire-causes/Winter -holidays )
Many holiday traditions involve candles. Candle fires peak 
in December and January with 11% of candle fires in each 
of these months.
Some holiday traditions have special decorations that are 
only used then. The condition of the decorations can 
degrade during storage. 
Installing decorations can require the use of extension 
cords or multiple wall outlet adapters. Extra cords can be 
an electrical and a trip hazard.
Fireworks are also a part of some holiday celebrations. Use 
extreme care with them. They are very dangerous!
Use  lights that are properly rated for indoor or outdoor use.
Inspect all wiring used for holiday decorating and avoid 
having too many things plugged into a single source. 
Replace any decorations with worn or broken cords or loose 
bulb connections.
Take extra care when using candles for decoration or 
symbolic purposes. Battery powered candles avoid potential 
ignition sources
Water your live holiday tree every day. Trees too close to a 
heat source cause one in every four winter fires.
Blow out lit candles and turn off all light strings and 
decorations when leaving the room or going to bed.
If you or a neighbor are using fireworks, watch for possible 
fires. Be prepared with a water hose or extinguisher.

On June 2, 2011, a tank exploded at a refinery in the United 
Kingdom (UK) which killed four contractor employees and 
seriously injured another. The force of the explosion blew the 
five-ton steel tank roof over 55 meters (180 ft.) and narrowly 
missed striking a pressurized sphere of highly flammable 
butane. The cause of the explosion was ignition of a 
flammable atmosphere within the tank. The probable ignition 
source was static electricity. 
More than 10 years before the incident, the facility changed 
the Amine Recovery Unit (ARU). To recover and reuse amine 
contained in a waste hydrocarbon stream (slop) from the 
Flare Knockout Drum were rerouted back to Tank 302 in the 
ARU rather than to the slop system that was designed to 
safely dispose of the waste stream. The facility had not 
documented this practice. This change resulted in 
accumulation of flammable liquid hydrocarbons on top of the 
amine liquid in T302. Some operators were aware of this 
hazard because they periodically drained the flammable 
liquid from tank 302.
The tank was being cleaned in preparation for maintenance. 
Neither the details of the tank drain system, nor instructions 
for proper draining of the hydrocarbons were used when 
preparing the tank. A vacuum truck removing liquids through 
a manway at the top of Tank 302 when the explosion 
occurred. A non -conductive hose was connected to the 
vacuum truck which caused a static charge, the probable 
ignition source. The permit issued for the cleaning work did 
not include the presence of flammable liquids.Management of Change (MOC) is included in all Process 
Safety regulations.
Many of the biggest incidents in our industry have 
happened because a change had unintended effects on the 
process. 
Changes of all types -equipment, chemicals, technology as 
well as operating and maintenance procedures -require

February 2023
A company was performing a hazard and risk 
assessment on their flammable liquid tank farm. 
While reviewing the safety systems, the setpoint of 
the high -high level alarm was questioned. The 
engineer (meekly) replied that this point was at 99% 
of the tank height. If this was true, during filling, the 
tank could overflow before the high -high alarm could 
warn the operator and action could be taken to stop 
flow. The team recognized this as a very serious gap 
and stopped the PHA. 
A small team of maintenance employees checked 
the high -high position on several tanks and found 
that they were positioned to activate at 99%. A 
temporary procedure was implemented to safely fill 
the tanks until new level devices could be installed 
at the proper level. 
The only reason the plant had not experienced 
overfilling of tanks was a single administrative 
control. The person who ordered bulk solvents 
carefully monitored tank levels and solvent 
consumption, then would only order the quantity to 
fill the tank to the 85% level. This single layer of 
protection was entirely based on the  performance of 
an individual, but the ordering criteria was not 
documented in a procedure.  In the hierarchy of controls, a properly designed 
engineering safeguard (e.g. high -level shutoff system) 
is more reliable, (stronger) than an administrative 
safeguard (an operator manually closing valves in 
response to the high -level alarm).
 Engineering controls need to be properly designed, 
installed and maintained (inspected, calibrated and 
tested).
 When a safeguard is based on administrative control, 
these attributes are required:
•A procedure is required to document proper 
actions and sequence. 
•The operators must be trained on how to safely 
follow the procedure.
•The operators must be able to demonstrate that 
they can perform the task as documented.
 All safeguards, engineering or administrative, must be 
able to respond quickly enough to avoid the undesirable 
event; it is meant to prevent or to minimize the impacts 
if it did occur.
When working on a process, you need to 
understand the safety systems and their function 
so you can properly respond when an upset 
occurs.
If during rounds or operation, you discover a 
safeguard is not working properly, report it 
immediately. You never know when it will be 
needed.
When participating in hazard reviews such as a 
PHA, do not hesitate to point out deficiencies in 
safety systems.High -High level alarm,

March 2023 Toxic Gases
Toxic gas exposures can be fatal. Take the correct actions to protect yourself and others.Toxic gases can cause poisonous effects at relatively low 
concentrations when in contact with the human body.  
Toxic gases are normally grouped as irritants like chlorine and 
ammonia, asphyxiants like nitrogen and carbon monoxide, 
anesthetics like nitrous oxide, and special toxicants like 
hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide.   
Inhalation of toxic gases can be swiftly fatal as the lungs 
provide a direct route to the blood stream.  Some materials can 
also be absorbed through the skin and eyes.
Toxic gases are especially dangerous because they are 
commonly stored and transported under pressure.  They 
rapidly expand and move through the air when released.  
Many, like hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide, are invisible 
and have unreliable or no odor warning properties.  
Lifting operations are dangerous work.  In some companies 
and countries, a formal lift plan is required.  Essential elements 
of such plans and safety practices for heavy lifts in areas 
where highly hazardous materials are present will be covered 
in a future Beacon.  
Preparation for materials handling operations involving toxic 
gases should always include what to do if a release occurs:  
Always beaware of the materials being handled, equipment 
in use, people and surroundings in the areas where you 
work.
Read andheed the warnings on labels, placards and 
signs where toxic gases are stored and used.
Stay wellaway of lifting operations and warn other 
personnel who are too close to move away.
Know where togoand what procedures to follow if there  is 
a release.
Begone, notdrawn to toxic gas releases unless you are 
trained and equipped as an emergency responder. Move 
cross -wind and away from the path of the gas release to 
approved safe havens and shelter -in-place locations.
Don, test-for-fitand userespirators, other personal 
protective equipment and portable gas detectors where 
authorized, available and suitable for the release at hand.Figure 1. Chlorine release from a dropped cylinder

On June 27, 2022, a 25 -ton isotainer of 
liquefied chlorine gas was being loaded onto 
a ship by a crane in Aqaba, Jordan. Alifting 
cable snapped, and the tank crashed onto the 
ship’s deck and ruptured. A huge cloud of 
toxic yellow chlorine gas formed and workers 
evacuated the area. Thirteen people were 
killed and about 300 others were hospitalized.
Officials stated  the tank’s weight was “three 
times more than the cable load capacity,” and 
the required safety measures for dealing with 
such hazardous material were not in place. 
No qualified person was on the deck at the 
time to check the lifting equipment and 
procedures. 
Experts said the incident could have become 
a catastrophe had dozens of workers ending a 
shift not left the site shortly before the leak. 
Fortunately, winds also blew the toxic gas 
away from populated areas in the port city to 
the outlying desert.
Precautions should be taken during chemical 
unloading operations in case of leaks, 
whether the materials are solids, liquids or 
gases. In this case, there were a number of 
people close to the loading area who did not 
need to be there at the time of the incident.What Happened?

Lifting Hazards
Lifting procedures must ensure that all safety precautions are taken BEFORE the lift is started !Lifting operations, whether for moving process equipment or 
chemicals, are dangerous work. In some companies and 
countries, a formal lift plan must be developed and approved 
prior to any lifting activity. Some issues addressed in such a 
lift plan or permit:
Equipment used for lifting must be rated for the weight 
of the load. It should have identification noting the 
rated capacity.
Lifting cables have a rated temperature range for safe 
use. 
Lifting equipment must be inspected prior to use.  
Crane operators and riggers must be certified for the 
equipment being used for the lift. 
The crane operator controls the crane’s movement. The 
rigger connects the load, signals the crane operator during 
movement and disconnects the load.
The lift plan needs to consider the weather conditions. 
When lifting hazardous chemicals or objects over operating 
chemical equipment, the lift plan should include any 
emergency response preparations that could be needed. Figure 1. Cable fails while lifting a Chlorine isotainer Did You Know?

The March Beacon covered an incident in 
the port of Aqaba, Jordan ,where a chlorine 
isotainer  was dropped onto a ship’s deck 
during the loading process releasing 25 tons 
of chlorine gas. The incident killed thirteen 
people and over 300 others were 
hospitalized. That Beacon focused on the 
hazards of toxic gases. This Beacon will 
focus on the physical cause of the incident: 
a poorly managed lift to load or unload 
hazardous chemicals. According to officials,  
the tank’s weight was “three times more 
than the cable load capacity.” 
A video shows the cable failure and 
isotainer rupture. Figure 1 has 2 
screenshots from that video.[link to video: 
https://youtu.be/0XYkMS6lMUs]
The officials added that the required safety 
measures for dealing with such hazardous 
materials were not in place and no qualified 
person was on the deck at the time to check 
the loading and unloading procedures.Check that all people involved are aware of the lift plan and 
their role in it. 
Verify that crane operator and rigger use the same hand 
signals even if they have radio communication.
Inspect the final location of the what is being lifted to ensure 
there is sufficient room for it and everything has been cleared 
from the area.
Never improvise. If the lift plan cannot be performed as 
written, STOP! Review the situation and get the proper 
people involved to modify the lift plan. This includes the 
approver of the original lift plan ,among others. 
Keep people away from the area. Never allow anyone to walk 
under the load.
Monitor the weather conditions. Wind and precipitation can 
make the lifting activities more dangerous. Know when to 
stop the lifting operation.

Manual chemical transfers require accurate procedures that are consistently followed !Every day, millions of pounds of hazardous materials are 
transferred from transportation vessels (trucks, railcars, 
cylinders, barges and ships) to the users’ sites. Most of 
these transfer operations are performed manually. 
Where delivery drivers are directly involved in unloading

management must share the responsibility to ensure 
chemicals are unloaded safely. 
Highly manual activities such as chemical loading and 
unloading require detailed procedures and well -marked 
piping and connection points. 
Some companies install unique fittings on load and unload 
piping so only the correct material hose can be connected.
Procedures should establish a requirement that facility 
personnel are physically present during deliveries. Both 
facility personnel and drivers should verify the correct 
connection before discharging chemicals using written 
checklists, piping diagram and/or equipment walk -downs.
Operators and drivers should wear the correct PPE for the 
material being handled and be trained on how to properly 
don it. Figure 1: Connections to chemical tanks at MGPI . Sulfuric Acid fill line

On October 21, 2016, two incompatible chemicals were 
accidentally mixed at the MGPI Processing, Inc. (MGPI) facility in 
Atchison, Kansas.  The incident occurred during a routine 
chemical delivery of sulfuric acid from the acid supplier to the 
MGPI facility tank farm. The truck driver incorrectly attached the 
delivery hose to a connection for a tank of sodium hypochlorite 
(bleach). These two materials are not compatible, and mixing  
sulfuric acid with sodium hypochlorite produced a cloud 
containing chlorine and other compounds.
The cloud impacted workers onsite and the surrounding 
community. Over 140 people, including members of the public, 
MGPI employees, and the truck driver, sought medical attention. 
One MGPI employee and five members of the public required 
hospitalization as a result of exposure to the cloud.
Several factors led to this incident:
Poor labeling of the connection points for different 
chemicals. (The labels in figure 1 were not present at the 
time of the incident, but were added to the photo for 
clarity)
A weak system to communicate the correct connection 
point between the company and the vendor’s driver. 
Failure of the operator to verify the correct connection 
before allowing transfer of the acid.
Errors and inconsistencies in the unloading procedure and 
poor understanding of that procedure by the operators .When making rounds, take notice of the pipe labeling. 
Missing or damaged labels should be replaced promptly.
Where loading or unloading stations have multiple 
connection points, ensure the connections are correct and 
well-marked. 
Read and follow the procedure for unloading. If some 
steps are not clear or incorrect, inform your supervisor 
and have them corrected.
During loading/unloading hazard analyses, ask what 
happens if the transfer hose is connected to the wrong 
tank.  The PHA team should use a chemical compatibility 
tool such as CRW4

June 2023 Sense of vulnerability –a very important safety component
What does a “sense of vulnerability” mean? It means that 
everyone in your plant:
• Understands the hazards associated with the  
materials and process conditions (pressure, 
temperature, etc.) in the area.
• Is constantly vigilant for symptoms of weaknesses 
that might indicate more serious events ahead, such 
as a small leak that could become a major line failure. 
• Stays vigilant even if the plant has good safety 
performance.
In our personal life, a sense of vulnerability is what causes us to 
slow our driving speed in bad weather or to be more cautious 
when working on a ladder. 
We can lose our sense of vulnerability when we are in a hurry. 
That can cause us to skip steps or forget to wear the correct 
PPE.
New employees may bring their sense of vulnerability from an 
earlier job or company. That means we may need to help them 
understand the hazards in their new job.
Maintaining a sense of vulnerability is an essential characteristic 
of a good process safety culture. Did You Know?

A person walking through a process area that 
handled sulfuric acid noticed an operator 
preparing to disconnect a nitrogen hose. The 
operator was not wearing the complete 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) required 
for the area, which included a face shield. The 
person stopped, pointed out the situation, 
and the operator willingly complied. The first 
person had only gone a few more steps when 
he heard a ‘pop’ and ‘hissing’ from the 
sulfuric area. The operator was drenched in 
acid and was helped to the nearest safety 
shower.
Unknown to the operator, sulfuric acid had 
backed up into the nitrogen hose. When it 
was disconnected, pressure sprayed the acid 
toward the operator’s face and body. The 
operator received only a few minor chemical 
burns on his neck because the required PPE 
had been worn. 
During the investigation, the operator’s face 
shield was found to be severely corroded and 
had a stain in the center where the acid had 
sprayed it. Without the face shield in place, 
the operator would have been seriously 
burned and could have permanently lost his 
vision.
Why did the first person stop and remind the 
operator of the complete PPE? A sense of 
vulnerability. The observer saw the potential 
for the hose to have acid in it, even though it 
SHOULD only contain nitrogen. If you see an at -risk behavior, stop, and askthe person if they 
are following the correct procedure. You could keep someone 
from being seriously hurt –or worse.
If someone stops you to ask about how you are performing a 
task, do not be defensive. They are trying to keep you safe. 
Answer their questions calmly, be open to their suggestions on 
how to perform the task and thank them for their concern 
about your safety.
If your area has newer employees, coach them on the unit  
hazards and procedures. Help keep them safe!
Never think, “It can’t happen here.” It can!

July 2023 Battery powered tools & devices can be ignition sources
People bring lithium -ion or other battery -
powered devices such as tablets, smart phones, 
and cordless tools, into classified areas. 
Batteries are energy sources that cannot be 
safely de -energized. Employees and 
contractors may not realize that these tools can 
be ignition sources. Even some approved 
battery -powered tools can be damaged if 
dropped. A device properly rated for a classified 
area, like a tablet, can be rendered unsuitable 
by adding non -approved  peripheral equipment, 
like headphones. 
While there have been no reported serious 
incidents in chemical operations from use of 
battery -powered equipment, it is only a matter of 
time before an unapproved device will provide 
the ignition source for a fire or explosion. Use or 
presence of non -classified electrical equipment 
in a hazardous area should be considered a 
near-miss –an incident or an operational 
interruption could have occurred if 
circumstances had been slightly different.
Battery -powered devices may present ignition sources that require  special attention !Battery -powered tools can be brought into a classified area by 
maintenance technicians or contractors, vendors or engineering 
personnel.
Field operators may use battery -powered tablets for data 
collection during rounds. 
Newer batteries operate at higher voltages ( >12 V) and can 
easily create a spark large enough to ignite flammable vapors.
Many flammable materials have a low minimum ignition energy 
(MIE). The minimum ignition energies for some common 
flammable materials are:
Changing  or removing a battery can cause a spark when 
contacts are connected or disconnected.
Non-classified devices can be safely used in classified area IF 
the hot work practices are followed (inspection of the area, 
testing/monitoring for flammable atmospheres, signed hot work 
permit, etc.)Figure 1. Battery -powered equipment Did You Know?
What Can You Do?This issue sponsored by

www.aiche.org/ccps/process -safety -beacon  
Know the electrical or hazardous area classification for the 
areas where you work.  If you do not know, ask your supervisor 
or an engineer assigned to the area.
Only use devices and equipment that are approved for the 
area’s classification. 
When you see others using battery -powered equipment, ask if 
the tools are properly rated. If the tools are not properly rated,  
ask them to discontinue use until the correct safety measures 
can be taken.
Use of non -approved devices should be reported as a near -
miss or unsafe act. 
A static spark you can feel 
is 1 to 10 mJ. That is 
enough energy to ignite 
many flammable materials 
and some combustible 
dusts.

August 2023 Simultaneous Operations (SIMOPS)
There was one fatality and two other workers 
seriously injured when they fell from a 5th floor 
platform. They were trying to climb down some 
piping to escape during a toxic hydrogen chloride 
(HCl) gas release. (See Figure 1.). There are 
several lessons from this incident. This Beacon 
focuses on just one: Simultaneous Operations, 
sometimes called SIMOPS.
All the injured workers belonged to a crew of 
insulators who were on the platform at the same 
time as a crew of pipefitters who were torquing bolts 
nearby. The pipefitters were appropriately protected 
against an HCl release by acid suits with full -face 
respiratory protection. The permit issuer for the 
insulation job did not adjust the PPE requirements, 
so they only had escape respirators and wore flame 
resistant (FR) clothing.Simultaneous operations refers to activities being done 
by multiple groups such as operations, contractors, 
maintenance or others, in the same area at the same 
time. 
Some operations –like offshore platforms –need to 
consider simultaneous operations more often. 
The most likely time for simultaneous operations to 
occur for most process units are associated with 
turnarounds –like in this incident. 
When issuing multiple permits in the same area, there 
are more possible hazards to consider.
The best way to avoid simultaneous operations issues 
is to adjust the schedule to avoid multiple operations in 
the same area.
When SIMOPS can’t be avoided, permit issuers should 
consider the possible interactions between the 
activities and between the various work crews.

Permits should be coordinated so potentially conflicting 
actions like draining of flammables and welding aren’t 
done in the same area at the same time. 
Simultaneous operations can also refer to operations 
such as starting up after a turnaround. Consider 
pausing work permits until the unit is running smoothly. 
One way to recognize and manage simultaneous 
operations is to group active permits for the same area 
in one place to increase awareness of simultaneous 
operations. 
Even if work in the same area is not conflicting 
simultaneous work may require a more detailed hazard 
review considering PPE, egress or other unique issues.
When doing any work on process equipment or piping, 
consider the possibility that containment could be lost. 
See the March 2022 Beacon for another  incident 
involving multiple contractors.

DO NOT let Lithium -ion batteries power a fire !Battery fire incidents are becoming more common  because lithium -
ion batteries are now in many consumer products, such as laptops, 
cameras, smartphones and more.
Devices have increased hazards during charging. Larger capacity 
batteries have a higher fire risk.
Fires involving Lithium -ion batteries are fast, intensive, difficult to 
contain or extinguish, and can produce hazardous fumes and gases. 
The batteries can also explode. After extinguishing, quarantine and 
monitoring are necessary –the batteries can re -ignite.
Faulty manufacturing, damage, misuse and aging of batteries can 
also increase the risk of battery fires.
Advice on safe handling of lithium -ion batteries is available from  
many sources. (such as, https://www.usfa.fema.gov/a -z/lithium -ion-

September 2023 Lithium -Ion Battery Hazards
Industrial use of lithium -ion batteries has 
been increasing over the past decade 
due to their long life, superior 
power/energy output, low maintenance, 
and lower weight. These benefits provide 
increased efficiency and cost saving.  
However, there is a flip side to consider. 
Additional hazards need to be identified, 
understood, and considered when 
changing and approving the devices 
used in classified areas. 
In this Beacon, we will provide some 
lessons learned from incidents with 
lithium -ion batteries and some 
recommendations on what you can do to 
better understand and prevent lithium -ion 
battery fires and explosions. 
Refer to the July 2023 Beacon for a 
review of battery -powered devices as 
ignition sources and guidance on their 
proper use in hazardous areas. 
(https://www.aiche.org/ccps/resources/proc
ess-safety -beacon/archives)Buy electronic devices from reputable retailers and use compatible 
batteries and chargers certified by a reputable agency.
If a fire occurs, unplug the battery if it can be done safely. Then 
evacuate the area and call emergency services. DO NOT try to put 
the fire out.
Batteries should also be routinely inspected to make sure there is no 
cracking, bulging or leaking.
Charging lithium -ion batteries creates heat. Do it on a solid surface 
and in an area with good ventilation. When charging a lithium -ion 
powered device, do it in a safe area and monitor the charging. Once 
a battery is fully charged, unplug it. 
Never throw lithium -ion batteries in the general trash. They require 
special disposal. Consult local waste disposal services for proper 
handling. 
If you use battery -powered vehicles in your plant only park them in 
approved areas, never near flammable materials.Figure 2: Lithium -ion battery fired 
demonstration.

October 2023 Keep the manway tightly closed 
On April 8, 2021, a mixture of flammable naphtha 
vapors and resin liquid became pressurized and 
was released through the manway of an operating 
reactor at a resin plant in Columbus, Ohio. The 
naphtha vapor spread through the enclosed 
building and formed a flammable vapor cloud both 
inside and outside the building. The operator tried 
to hit the emergency -stop button, but he could not 
see through the white vapor and had difficulty 
breathing. He had also been sprayed with hot resin 
during the release. He evacuated the building and 
approximately two minutes later, the flammable 
vapor cloud ignited, causing  an explosion and fire. 
One employee was fatally injured, and eight others 
were transported to area hospitals for injuries. The 
blast shook neighboring buildings, and at least one 
nearby business sustained damage. The resin 
plant was severely damaged and was demolished 
after the incident.Incorrect number of clamps or bolts or improper 
tightening can cause manways and other covers 
to leak below the design pressure.
The gaskets are another key part of sealing 
hatches. They must be properly rated, correctly 
positioned and in good condition to provide a 
good seal.
Another  incident occurred when the manway 
started leaking before the relief device could 
open and was the subject of the March 2021 
Beacon. 
Adding a volatile material or solvent to a process 
above the solvent’s boiling point can produce 
rapid boiling also known as flashing. This can 
quickly increase the vessel pressure. 
All connections need to be properly tightened so 
any overpressure vents through the relief system 
and to a safe location. The first 6 seconds of the vapor release from the resin vessel 
manway. (reference CSB incident report No. 2021 -04-I-O)Did You Know?

Know the correct way to secure vessel hatches. 
Details such as how many bolts or clamps and  
torque requirements are important to preventing 
leaks.
Operating procedures should provide the 
correct way to secure hatches and manways. If 
these details are missing, notify the supervisor 
to add them. 
The correct gasket type, material and rating 
should also be specified in the procedure for 
securing openings.
Leaking flanges often “whistle” or “hiss” as 
material leaks out. When you hear this sound, 
leave the area, and ask the area supervisor for 
guidance.

November 2023 The agitator stopped! Now what??
Agitators can stop due to  mechanical, power or 
control failures. Agitator failure may be  detected by 
the control system, or through visual inspection.
When some mechanical failures occur, the agitator 
motor can be running, but there is no mixing. 
Certain process steps, such as sampling, may require 
the agitator to be temporarily stopped. Operating  
procedures need to explain when to stop and restart 
agitation.  
Adding a volatile material or solvent to a process 
above the solvent’s boiling point can produce rapid 
boiling and increase pressure. 
Agitation moves  material to the cooling surfaces. 
When agitation is stopped, cooling is also reduced.
When the agitator is restarted, volatile materials may 
vaporize and increase the reactor pressure. 
The decision to restart the agitator depends on many 
factors such as how long it has been off, the materials 
in the process, and others. (See the August 2018 
Beacon)
Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) should include 
agitator failure and restart as a topic of review and 
discussion . Figure 1. Resin building after the internal explosion

The incident occurred when the reaction in a vessel was 
nearly complete. While the operator was not near the 
reactor, the agitator shut down. A few minutes later, the 
operator began cooling the kettle’s contents; the agitator 
should have been running, but it remained stopped.
The operator added solvent into the top of the kettle. 
The batch temperature was about 430 °F (221 °C), and 
the solvent was at approximately 70 °F (21 °C). The 
operator noticed that the temperature was not dropping 
and looked through the sight glass on the manway and 
noticed the agitator had stopped. Knowing that the 
agitator was supposed to run while cooling, he turned it 
back on.
The agitation mixed the stagnant layers of hot resin and 
liquid solvent. The solvent  vaporized, and quickly 
increased the pressure inside the kettle ; this triggered 
the kettle’s high -pressure alarm. Within a few seconds,  
liquid resin and flammable solvent vapor were eject ed 
from the manway, which quickly filled the enclosed room 
with white vapor. The operator tried to turn off the 
agitator, but failed because he could not see and had 
been sprayed with hot resin. He then evacuated. About 
2 minutes after the release began, the vapor cloud 
ignited and exploded. One employee was killed, eight 
others required medical attention. The resin building 
was destroyed . (See Figure 1)
Operating chemical processes requires careful 
monitoring of the process variables: temperature, 
pressure, and agitator status.
When the procedure directs you to stop the agitator 
and take an action, read the entire step to determine 
whether to restart it or not after the action is 
completed.
If the agitator stops or you find it did not restart, 
contact your supervisor to determine the correct 
action. 
During PHAs, agitator failure must be carefully 
reviewed. There are many variables to determine  
the hazards and proper corrective actions.

December 2023 The Worst Ammonia Incident Ever -What Can We Learn?
Overfilling Vessels Can Have Catastrophic Results!Tanks, especially those in liquefied gas service, 
have a rated capacity. It should be documented 
in the equipment design information, kept at a 
facility. 
Tanks should be built to the correct codes or 
standards. These codes also specify the 
methods to repair, test and recertify the tank. 
They also require that repairs are only made by 
people certified to make them. 
Frequent repairs and maintenance problems are 
process safety warning signs. Tanks should not 
develop cracks and if they do, it is a serious 
concern.
Ammonia is acutely toxic; inhaling it can lead to 
respiratory failure. Skin contact with liquid 
ammonia causes thermal burns due to the 
extreme cold.Parts of the tank truck after the explosionDid You Know?

On March 24, 1992, the worst ammonia release in history 
occurred at a peanut oil processing mill in Dakar, Senegal. An 
ammonia tank truck vessel broke in half causing the release of 
22 metric tons (50,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia. Debris 
from the explosion pierced other nearby process equipment 
also containing ammonia. The dense ammonia cloud quickly 
spread over the oil mill, surrounding businesses, and nearby 
community. Ultimately, 129 people were killed and 1150 were 
injured. 
Why did this event happen? The tank was not permanently 
installed; it was a tank truck that was filled at the ammonia 
supplier’s site, then transported to the mill. The tanker was 
built to regulations and was 11 years old when it failed. 
Repeated overfilling of the tank led to overpressurization and 
crack formation. This was detected in 1991. Maintenance 
workers repaired the cracks and the tank continued to be 
used. The day before the incident, the tank was filled to 124% 
of the rated capacity.
In liquified gas service, over pressurization can lead to 
significant stress and, as in this case, cause the tank to fail. To 
add to the catastrophe, the mill had a poorly planned 
emergency response program. Fortunately, this event 
occurred during the Ramadan holidays when there were fewer 
people nearby.Critical process information such as maximum 
tank fill level should be noted on the tank, at the 
filling connection location and be a special 
warning in the filling procedure.
Never overfill or exceed the rated capacity of a 
vessel. If more material is delivered than the 
rated capacity of the receiving tank , consult your 
supervisor.
Repairs to tanks and other equipment require 
specialized expertise. If asked to perform a repair 
that you are not trained or certified to do, question 
it. Better to have a process delay than a process 
disaster.

January 2024 An Error Trap Leads to a Catastrophe
Did You Know?This issue sponsored by
Messages for Manufacturing Personnel
www.aiche.org/ccps/process -safety -beacon  
A fuel terminal was off -loading a large amount of gasoline 
from a ship to several storage tanks. The supervisor 
incorrectly estimated the time to fill one tank ,and it 
overflowed into the containment (dike) area. 
Unfortunately, the valve to drain rainwater from the 
containment had been left open and the gasoline flowed 
out to the retention  pond near the wastewater 
treatment (WWT) area. The pumps in the WWT area 
were not classified for flammable vapor. The vapors 
ignited ,and the fire spread back toward the overflowing 
tank. A number of explosions and a facility -wide fire had 
catastrophic impacts on the plant, community and 
sensitive environmental areas around the terminal.
How did this happen?
The tank farm used both rising stem (Fig. 1) and fixed 
stem valves (Fig 2.) on the dike drains leading to the 
storm water retention pond in the WWT area. Rising stem 
valves allowed operators to easily see the valve position 
by observing the stem above the valve wheel ( redarrow).  
Fixed stem valves do not provide a visual indication of the 
position ( blue arrow) :The stem does not rise above the 
handwheel when the gate is raised. It was difficult for 
operators to know the actual position of the fixed stem 
valve on the dike drain for the tank dike without 
physically turning it.
Poor lighting in the area made it difficult for operators to 
see the valve positions . For more details, see CSB Report NO. 
2010.02.I.PR 
Figure 1: Rising Stem valves Figure 2 :Fixed Stem valves
▪There are two styles of gate valves that look similar. (Figures 1 
and 2) . 
▪Having  two different style valves in the same service can create 
an ‘error trap’, a situation where a mistake is more likely.
▪Operating procedures provide instruction on the safe operation 
of a process. Where valve positions can be confusing, pictures 
help explain the right valve position.
▪Poor lighting in remote areas can make minor differences in 
equipment difficult to see and was a factor in this event. 
What Can You Do?
▪If you notice equipment that looks similar but operates 
differently, tell your supervisor. There may be several ways to 
remove the error trap:
▪Add pictures to improve operating procedures by showing 
the correct position or alignment for the valves or other 
equipment.
▪Replace some valves so they all operate the same way and 
make such changes using Management of Change (MOC).
▪Where poor lighting makes operations more difficult, recommend 
improving the lighting in the area to reduce errors and improve 
general safety. (Again, follow MOC)
▪Some companies consider error traps near -misses and want them 
reported using a near -miss or other reporting form.
▪Also see the June 2006 Beacon for another valve error incident.

Do not let vacuum collapse your equipment!•When a process runs at less than atmospheric 
pressure (vacuum), the process contains less air 
than at atmospheric pressure. If it is operating 
near full vacuum, (0 psia or 0 mm Hg), there is 
little air in the process.
•Equipment rated for internal pressure may not be 
rated for vacuum. Pressure and vacuum ratings for 
equipment can be found on the equipment tag or 
the equipment data sheet.
•Vacuum control systems reduce the pressure by 
opening valves to a vacuum source. The pressure 
can be  raised by adding a gas (usually inert) into 
the process to raise the pressure. 
•For boiling processes, lower pressure allows most 
materials to boil at a lower temperature. This is 
often how high boiling materials are separated.Did You Know?

What happened? A process containing flammable materials was 
operating under vacuum. Suddenly, the vent line collapsed. 
Equipment can collapse when the internal pressure caused by the 
vacuum is lower than the equipment’s vacuum rating. Vacuum can 
be created inside equipment by:
•Exposing equipment to a strong vacuum source, such as an 
eductor or vacuum pump, without adding agas to control the 
pressure (See Figure 1)
•Draining a tank without properly venting the headspace.
•Cooling a tank without venting it –this can even occur if a vessel 
vent is blocked and the ambient temperature decreases like a 
sudden rain.
•Steaming a vessel without venting it –the water vapor can 
condense and create a vacuum inside the equipment (see 
Figure 2)
Why is creating vacuum a problem? Beyond the potential for 
vessel collapse, vacuum can cause other potentially unsafe 
conditions. Air can be drawn into the equipment; if the process 
contains flammable materials, an ignition or explosion could occur. 
Vacuum could also cause materials in the process to boil 
unexpectedly or foam. There is also a risk of backflow in 
equipment, since materials tend to flow toward lower pressure 
points in the process.▪Understand how the vacuum systems work for 
your processes –both how the vacuum is created 
and how the pressure is controlled.
▪Recognize that loss of vacuum in a flammable 
system could mean that air got into the process. 
Follow your unit’s procedures to manage the 
upset.
▪Do not block the vent of a tank without providing 
a venting path, such as a vacuum relief device.
▪Don’t steam out equipment or pump material out 
of a tank or vessel without a venting path or other 
means of protection from vacuum.
▪During hazard reviews, discuss all the possible 
causes of vacuum. Some consequences may be 
more than a quality problem; they could be an 
unsafe situation.Vacuum can put a dent in your process!

What happened –a process suddenly starts 
operating erratically and shuts down. It could be an 
instrument failure, but what really caused the 
upset? 
During an unplanned shutdown, the focus may be 
on restarting the operation. Pressures to return the 
process to operation may not allow thorough 
troubleshooting. The quick solution is to ‘do what 
fixed it last time’. That can lead to other problems.
Also, normal operation has been interrupted. There 
may be extra people in the control room to assist 
with the restart. Maintenance people may be asking 
questions to determine the sequence of events that 
led to the shutdown. Field personnel may be 
receiving multiple requests for data or equipment 
status. 
Trying to resolve the problem and return to 
operation deserves extra time to consider the safety 
concerns. The process could have changed before 
and during the shutdown; an analysis could identify 
potentially dangerous situations that need to be 
addressed during troubleshooting and restart 
operations. 
Process upsets are the time to slow down and think ! ▪Most processes have a troubleshooting guide to 
determine the cause of the upset and provide 
solutions to fix it. 
▪Troubleshooting Instructions should also address 
how to safely diagnose the failure(s) and 
emphasize being safe while addressing the 
problem.
▪Emergency shutdown and normal shutdown 
procedures may result in different process 
operating modes. Equipment condition and valve 
positions may not be the same after the process is 
stopped.
▪A process that has been shut down for any reason 
needs an Operational Readiness Review, that is 
broader than a Pre -Startup Safety Review (PSSR).
▪Companies may have different procedures for 
restarting a process after an emergency shut 
down and a normal shut down. Did You Know?

▪Understand how the control systems work  and 
the safe operating window of the process and 
what the process shutdown points are.
▪Know how to quickly access  the Troubleshooting 
Instructions for your processes. Occasionally  
review these instructions and the steps to 
diagnose process upsets.
▪Address all the possible causes and 
consequences of process failures during hazards 
reviews. Some deviations may be more than a 
quality problem; they could be an unsafe 
situation.
▪Follow the operational readiness checklist and 
verify all components are in the correct position 
BEFORE starting up.

Get Out and Stay Out!
On January 28, 2021, liquid nitrogen overflowed from 
an immersion freezer located inside a food 
processing facility in Gainesville, Georgia. The 
incident resulted in 6 fatalities and four injuries. The 
release began while maintenance workers were 
troubleshooting the freezer. Liquid nitrogen was 
released, vaporized, and accumulated inside the 
room which had no mechanical ventilation. The two 
maintenance workers who were troubleshooting the 
freezer were fatally asphyxiated from the nitrogen 
vapor.
The uncontrolled liquid nitrogen release went 
undetected for 30 to 60 minutes until another worker 
looked for the maintenance workers and saw a 4ft 
(1.2 meter) high vapor cloud filling the room. This 
worker reported the incident to management, who 
initiated an evacuation. During the building -wide 
evacuation, at least 14 other employees, including 
management, responded to the incident by either 
investigating the freezer room or attempting to rescue 
coworkers. As a result, four additional employees 
were fatally asphyxiated. Three other employees and 
a firefighter were treated for asphyxiation symptoms.
For additional details see US Chemical Safety Board report No. 
2021 -03-I-GA
Know your emergency evacuation procedures and follow them !▪Areas where hazardous gases are stored, processed, or 
generated as a by -product should be ventilated to 
prevent exposure to the gas. 
▪A gas detection and alarm system designed for the 
specific gases should be installed to monitor the area and 
notify personnel when high levels are present. 
▪People working in or near these areas should wear 
personal gas monitors that can detect and alert them of 
high concentrations of the hazardous gas. 
▪Many hazardous gas -related fatalities occur when others 
attempt to rescue a coworker in a toxic or oxygen 
deficient atmosphere. No one should enter a potentially 
hazardous space without proper permits, preparation, 
and breathing apparatus.
▪Evacuation alarms notify people that a serious event has 
occurred. The proper response must be communicated to 
employees, visitors and contractors in their site safety 
orientation.
▪Know where nitrogen or other hazardous gases are 
being used in your area. If you see potential release 
points such as open pipes, relief discharges request a 
work order to have them capped or properly vented.
▪If you work in an area where hazardous gases are 
present, know the alarm signals for the hazardous gas 
detection systems used there. 
▪When a detection alarm sounds, do not wait or try to 
investigate, evacuate the area immediately.  Only 
personnel properly trained and with the correct PPE 
should be allowed to investigate until the area is safe.
▪If there are visitors or contractors working in a 
hazardous area, confirm they know how to safely 
evacuate.
▪Once you are in the designated safe area, stay there! 
Leaving the area could expose you to a fatal dose of 
toxic material.
▪The only safe time to return to the area is after the ‘all -
clear’ status has been announced.Figure 1. Employees evacuated from food processing plantDid You Know?

May 2024 Does the piping meet the specification?
A vapor cloud explosion and fire led to one fatality and two 
serious injuries. At least 28 other workers were injured. Abo ut 
10,000 lb. (4500 kg.) of flammable isobutylene was released 
when a  3 -inch (75mm) Y -strainer failed, likely due to thermal 
expansion. The vapor cloud ignited causing an explosion. 
This Beacon focuses on using piping materials approved in the 
pipe specification. 
The Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for the piping had 
several errors. It didn’t show the Y -strainer, a check -valve nor a 
manual isolation valve. A Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) was 
performed when the system was installed and was revalidated 
about a year before the accident. No one noted that the P&ID did 
not match the field piping. According to the drawing, the piping 
was welded or flanged 304 stainless steel. The 3 -inch diameter 
cast iron Y-strainer was connected to the stainless steel line using 
threaded joints. Most industry pipe specifications would certainly 
prohibit 3 -inch threaded connections in isobutylene service. 
Cast metal devices, like this strainer, are more brittle than 
stainless steel. They can fail and are specifically prohibited in 
pressurized hydrocarbon service by several industry piping 
standards.
Does your company follow its pipe specifications?▪Design of new piping systems should follow 
industry -approved piping specifications. They 
provide guidance for temperature, pressure and 
correct materials.
▪Most companies have internal piping specifications 
for various process and utility fluid services. 
▪If your company doesn’t have its own piping  
specifications, groups like Process Industry 
Practices (PIP), American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers (ASME), European Committee for Iron 
and Steel Standardization (ECISS), and Japanese 
Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) have 
standards that can be adopted by the company.
▪Threaded connections are seldom used in larger 
diameter hazardous service piping. They may be 
used for small diameter instrument or sampling 
connections. 
▪Any deviation from pipe specifications should 
require a Management of Change review that 
includes an analysis of the modification by a 
technical team. 
▪All piping installations should have a Prestart -up 
Safety review (PSSR) to ensure the piping meets 
the correct specification.Figure 2 .A large hole in the 
strainer.  Excess pressure caused

▪The P&IDs should accurately  show the  process 
piping as it exists in the field. If they do not, report 
it to your supervisor. 
▪A good practice is for the PHA facilitator to field –
check the accuracy of the P&ID’s prior to starting 
the study. 
▪If you see any threaded connections (over 3/4 
inch (19 mm) diameter) in hazardous service, 
report it to your supervisor so they can be 
checked. 
▪If a piping change is needed, use the company’s 
MOC system so the proper reviews are 
performed.

June 2024 Good evacuation plans save lives!
Know your evacuation procedures –and follow them!▪In plants where hazardous chemicals are stored or 
handled, the emergency plan must include spills and 
gaseous releases of hazardous materials. 
▪In most countries, companies are required to have a 
written emergency response plan which addresses 
foreseeable natural emergencies that could occur 
such as severe weather, flooding, earthquakes, and 
tsunamis. The plan also needs to address fires and 
safe evacuation of the site.
▪Fires in industrial operations can spread very quickly. 
Even in an office, carpeting and other combustible 
materials can ignite and burn rapidly.
▪A key to reducing the impact of a fire or release is 
timely  activation of the emergency alarm system. 
Hesitation or delay in sounding the alarm can delay 
evacuation and firefighting efforts.
▪Some regulations require a visual  map of the 
evacuation routes, safe havens for shelter -in-place, 
and gathering areas.Figure 1. JAL 516 fire and the locations of the planes involved Did You Know?

On January 2, 2024, Japan Airlines (JAL) Flight 516 
carrying  367 passengers and 12 crew members 
was landing at Haneda Airport in Tokyo Japan. It 
collided with a smaller Coast Guard plane on the 
runway and both aircraft caught fire. Five of the six 
crew on board the smaller plane died in the collision. 
All 379 occupants of JAL Flight 516 safely were 
evacuated within 18 minutes of landing even though 
the left engine of the JAL plane was on fire. 
The safe evacuation of a large plane is the result of 
a well -understood evacuation plan. Despite a 
communication failure between the cockpit and the 
flight attendants, there were no fatalities on Flight 
516. The crew took swift action to inflate the 
emergency slides As soon as they saw it was safe. 
They moved passengers to the slides in a quick but 
orderly way. Pilots and flight attendants are trained 
to initiate evacuation of planes as soon as possible.
Another reason for the safe evacuation was the crew 
insisted that passengers leave everything but their 
phones behind. Bringing other items along could 
have slowed the exit process and led to fatalities. 
This is emphasized in the airline’s preflight safety 
message and the passengers obeyed those 
instructions. ▪Know the emergency evacuation procedures for your 
work area including –evacuation routes, shelter -in-
place locations, and gathering points.
▪Know how and when to activate emergency alarms 
in your area. If you are not sure, ask your supervisor.
▪Actively participate in emergency drills. Take note of 
any issues that could impact a real emergency such 
as clutter in the exit routes, poor walking surfaces, or 
missing exit signs.
▪When making rounds or field inspections think about 
what emergencies could occur and if that emergency 
is included in the evacuation plan.
▪Once you leave the area, do not return until the ‘all 
clear’ status has been announced. (see the April 
2024 Beacon) "

July 2024 Are your P&IDs up to date? 
In 2019, an explosion followed a 10,000 lbs. (4500kg) 
release of flammable isobutylene from a failed Y -
strainer. It fatally injured one worker and seriously 
injured two others. The incident also injured 28 and 
resulted in the operating company's bankruptcy. This 
Beacon focuses on only one of many lessons learned 
from this incident --the tremendous pressure that occurs 
when trapped liquids expand.
The piping & instrumentation diagram (P&ID) for the Y -
strainer piping had errors (Figure 1). The version used 
forthe process hazards analysis (PHA) did not show 
the Y -strainer, a check -valve nor the manually -activated 
isolation valves. These combined to make a section 
where liquids could be trapped. The facility completed 
an initial PHA and PHA revalidation.   During both 
PHAs, the team did not detect the incorrect P&ID and 
therefore failed to recognize the liquid expansion 
hazard. 
The drawing also indicated the piping was all welded or 
flanged 304 stainless steel. The 3” diameter cast -iron Y -
strainer was connected to the stainless piping by pipe -
threaded joints which didn’t meet accepted piping 
specifications. (See the May 2024 Beacon)
Current & accurate P&IDs are the backbone of an effective PHA▪Thermal expansion of liquids can generate 
tremendous internal pressure on pipes and 
other process equipment. It can occur in 
blocked -in lines, especially those containing 
liquified gases such as isobutylene. 
▪The P&IDs are a key input to the Process 
Hazards Analysis (PHA) process. P&ID 
accuracy is critical to a thorough and accurate 
understanding of the process and its hazards.
▪The PHA team reviews each section of the 
P&IDs, looking for things that could go wrong 
in that section and cause issues in that 
section or elsewhere.
▪Good risk management practices and most 
process safety regulations require the P&IDs 
be current and accurate and used when a 
PHA is performed.
▪PHAs are required to be revalidated or 
reviewed on a regular interval. 
▪One purpose of revalidations is to review 
changes that have occurred and to verify 
those changes are properly managed.Figure 1 . A simplified diagram showing the configuration that caused a

▪Your P&IDs should accurately reflect the 
process as it exists in the field. If they don’t, 
report that to your supervision. 
▪If you are participating in a PHA study, check 
the P&IDs for accuracy. If they’re not correct, 
point this out to the team.
▪A recommended practice for PHAs is for the 
team to visit the process area under study. 
These visits are an opportunity to note special 
hazards, safeguards or piping issues.

What Happened?
In Figure 1 ., an older section of piping had 
corroded, but a decision was made to 
continue operation until the next inspection. 
The piping failed, released hot, flammable 
liquid, that formed a vapor cloud. It ignited and 
caused a large fire There were no fatalities.
In Figure 2., a spherical tank in Liquified 
Natural Gas (LNG) service was being hydro 
tested. Water (specific gravity of 1.0) was 
used as the test material but is over twice as 
dense as LNG (specific gravity = 0.45). The 
legs of the sphere were fire -proofed and no 
one recognized that corrosion had occurred 
under the fireproofing. The additional load of 
the water caused the legs to fail. One person 
was injured, and another fatally injured.▪Corrosion can occur inside and outside of process 
equipment, and on support structures.
▪Corrosion is a reaction between a material, usually metal, 
and its environment. The most familiar is the corrosion of 
iron or steel to form iron oxides or rust.
▪There are many mechanisms for corrosion. The figures 
show only two.
▪Most corrosion mechanisms are slow and take years to 
cause equipment failure. However, under some conditions, 
corrosion can be surprisingly fast. 
▪Corrosion rates are typically stated as milli -inches per year 
or micrometers (microns) per year (1 milli -inch = 25.4 
micrometer). When reviewing corrosion data, it is important 
to know which units were used to measure the corrosion 
rate.
▪Concrete can be corroded by acidic materials. This can 
degrade the effectiveness of containment systems for 
tanks, piping, and loading/unloading operations.
▪Not all corrosion involves metals. Gaskets, O -rings, and 
other non -metal parts can fail from material attack.
▪ When making rounds, watch for signs of corrosion such as 
discolored insulation, stains on equipment, piping, or 
structures, and damaged concrete.
▪ Watch for places where insulation has been damaged and 
water can saturate the insulation or fireproofing. 
▪ Material dripping from insulated lines it may indicate that 
the insulation has been damaged, but it could also be a 
leak. Treat all ‘drips’ with care and report them to your 
supervisor. Do not try to identify the leak without proper 
PPE.
▪ When opening piping and equipment, examine the gaskets 
and O -rings. If they show signs of attack such as 
discoloration or cracks, point this out to your supervisor. It 
may indicate the gasket or O -ring material is not correct for 
the present service.Corrosion –another hidden threat

Are You Prepared ??
We have seen movies of 1500’s era warriors 
preparing for battle. They sharpen swords, test 
their shields and don their armor and helmets. 
Leaders explain the plans for the ensuing 
conflict, and they all go to their stations to await 
the start of the battle. Some movies also show 
the soldiers thinking about possible injuries, or 
worse, that could happen. They are prepared for 
the challenges of the day. 
Are you prepared for the start of your day? At 
the beginning of a shift, workers don their PPE –
safety glasses, fire resistant clothing, boots, and 
helmets. It may be necessary to calibrate a 
meter or personal gas monitor. The production 
schedule and inspection tasks have been 
outlined by the unit leaders and are 
communicated to the workers during the shift 
handover and start-of-shift meetings . 
The hazards of the process and equipment are 
the enemy and the battle is to keep them 
contained. Every day when making rounds, 
inspections , repairing faulty or failing equipment 
and devices. Do we take our jobs as seriously 
as those warriors of old? While you put on your 
PPE are you also thinking about the hazards 
you will face today?
Start your day prepared for the challenges ahead!▪Planning is an important part of every safe and successful 
workday. 
▪Effective shift turnover should be a face -to-face discussion 
between the personnel ending their shift with those 
beginning the shift.
▪Good shift turnover meetings include:
▪Status of each process
▪Any upsets or production problems that occurred
▪Equipment that is off -line for maintenance
▪Any equipment or controls that are bypassed or 
off-line
▪Any  contractor work underway
▪Permitted work that will continue on the next shift
▪Visitors or workers in the unit from another plant 
area.
▪Review of the unit logbook
•It may be necessary to visit the field to see the exact 
situation that is being discussed.
•Some companies use a checklist or form to list all the 
topics to be covered during turnover.
▪Arrive at the control room or shift turnover area in time to 
allow all information to be discussed.
▪Read the logbook carefully. Do not just look for issues in 
your area, understand the situation in the entire area or 
unit.
▪Follow the shift turnover forms and procedures to cover all 
the problems and concerns.
▪Ask questions to ensure the present status of the process 
is well understood.
▪Actively participate in the shift turnover meetings. Listen as 
if your life depends on it –it may!
▪If permits need to be rewritten for the next shift, take the 
time to inspect the area before writing or approving the 
permit. Conditions may have changed. Figure 1. A knight prepared

October 2024 Some short -cuts may cut lives short
▪Human error is always a possible source of system 
malfunction. But applying both engineering and 
administrative controls can prevent serious incidents. 
▪Many standards and regulations originate from previous 
incidents. The intent of these standards is to protect 
workers from risks they cannot afford to learn through 
experience.
▪Many incidents happen when safeguards (engineering or 
administrative) fail or are deliberately by -passed.
▪A non -standard method may have been used once by 
exception only. With human nature liking easier ways to 
do things, the exception becomes routine. This 
normalization of the deviance is a dangerous behavior, 
not a safe thing to do!
▪The right way to open energized equipment is to use 
isolation and Lockout/Tagout methods accurately.Figure 1: The fires after the explosions took 10 hour s to be brought

Thirty -five years ago , 85,000 pounds (39 metric tons) of process 
gas, mostly ethylene, were released from a plastics plant in 
Pasadena, Texas. The cloud ignited two minutes later. Debris 
flew as far as 6 miles (10 km), luckily hitting no one. The 
following fire caused the explosion of a 20,000 -gallon (75 m³) 
isobutane tank;  other explosions followed. On the site, 23 
employees and contractors were fatally injured. Another 314
workers were injured. Extensive damage to the site and 
business interruption caused financial losses of about $1.5 
billion US.
Workers were clearing a settling leg (pipe to collect polymer) on
a polyethylene loop reactor. Co mpany and industry safety 
standards required isolation by means of a double -block system 
or the use of a blind flange. However, the plant used a simpler 
procedure with a single isolation point. An effective permit -to-
work system for employees and contractors was also not 
enforced by the company. 
The accident investigation established that the single ball valve 
isolating the settling leg from the process was opened at the 
time of the release. The air hoses to the valve had been 
connected, which was against procedures, and cross -connected 
so that the air for closing the valve opened it . The investigation 
concluded that process gas was intended to push down some 
polymer that blocked the pipe, but that could not be confirmed 
OSHA reported many deficiencies, but this Beacon will look at 
the safe work procedures.
“Looking Back: PHILLIPS 66 Explosion, Pasadena, TX”, P. Sibilski, North 
Jersey Section AIChE Virtual Meeting, May 27, 2020).▪Understand the major hazards at your plant. Know the 
critical safeguards against those hazards and be sure 
those safeguards are working properly.
▪Do not bypass safeguards without an assessment, 
special procedure, and additional safeguards that were 
approved by a Management of Change (MOC) process. 
The temporary removal or bypassing of safeguards 
should never be considered normal procedure. 
▪If you think a process or procedure could be made 
simpler, submit your idea to your supervisors. It may be 
an improvement, but it must be assessed to be 
workable and safe and get proper review and 
authorization.
▪If you see someone taking shortcuts, point out the right 
procedure –it is to everyone’s benefit to do things 
safely.
▪Everyone must have the operational discipline to “carry 
out each task, the right way, every time”.

November 2024 Announcing International Process Safety Week!!
▪CCPS and other process safety organizations provide a 
week of learning opportunities during the International 
Process Safety Week (IPSW) on December 2 -6, 2024.  
link: www.aiche.org/ccps/ipsw
▪The intent of this week is to remember the importance of 
process safety and what happens when process safety is 
not managed correctly.
▪Many companies have experienced significant incidents 
that have changed their operations and influenced their 
culture. Maybe your company has one or more of these 
events. You may have certain policies or procedures 
intended to prevent similar incidents from recurring.
▪Process safety events happen in companies of all sizes

Process Safety communities around the world 
are working together to present the 1st  
International Process Safety Week [IPSW] on 
2-6 December 2024. Process Safety needs 
relentless vigilance. The IPSW is intended to 
promote this vigilance and to remind us of past 
significant incidents and the lessons learned. 
IPSW will help unify our thoughts and 
commitment to continuous improvement to 
achieve a “World without Process Safety 
Incidents”.
We urge all readers of the CCPS Process 
Safety Beacon and others to register for this 
unique online event. Entry to this event is free, 
but registration is required. The QR code 
below will take you to the registration page. 
This is a great opportunity for all of us to take 
stock of our past learning and commit to work 
together for the benefit of process safety. It is 
a common thread we all inspire to learn and 
improve. Working together to protect society 
from consequences of hazardous operations, 
is more important than ever. 
Join us and  learn how to prevent future process safety incidents. ▪Ask your supervisor what events from the IPSW your unit 
will attend. Many of the presentations will be available after 
the week’s events for viewing.
▪Your company may have a serious process safety incident 
in its past. Ask your supervisor or some of the senior 
people if they know of them. The lessons from such events 
shape the operations and culture of the company. 
Discussing these can reinforce why process safety is 
imperative to daily operations.
▪An internet search can reveal some of the lessons learned 
from past incidents. Many of them have a report that is 
available to review.
▪Focus your daily safety messages on the incidents that 
have occurred in your company or neighboring companies .

December 2024 Stored chemicals are still hazardous
Know the hazards of the materials stored in your area! Did You Know?
What Can You Do?This issue sponsored by

www.aiche.org/ccps/process -safety -beacon  
▪Recognize the materials currently stored in your 
area and know the hazards of these materials.
▪When participating in PHAs, do not forget to review 
ALL  the materials in the process, including the feed 
materials and products that are stored. 
▪If your area handles or stores materials with a 
known shelf life, know how they are managed. If you 
see materials that are near or beyond their 
expiration date, notify your supervisor. 
▪When permitted work is planned in a material 
storage area the hazards of the materials in the area 
need to be reviewed and understood before 
approving the permit. This month marks the 40thanniversary of the Bhopal 
disaster where highly toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) was 
released from a storage tank. This event caused 
thousands of fatalities. None of the safeguards designed 
to mitigate a release of MIC worked, including the 
scrubber, flare, and deluge system. The company did not 
recognize  that materials in storage are just as hazardous 
as those being created or used in a process.
There have been many catastrophic incidents where 
material was in storage. Several involve ammonium 
nitrate (AN):
West Texas, USA (2013) fatally injured 15 injured 260.  
An estimated 40 to 60 tons (36 –54 metric tons)  of AN 
were detonated by a fire in the storage building. (Fig ure
1)
Port of Tianjin, China (2015) where the detonation of 
about 800 tons (725 metric tons) of AN caused 173 fatal 
injuries and 798 non -fatal injuries. ( Figure 2)
Port Beirut, Lebanon (2020) 2400 ton s(2,177 metric 
tons) of AN from an abandoned ship was stored for 6 
years until the explosion. 218 people died, 7,000 were  
injured. ( Figure 3)▪It is critical to understand the hazards, the amount, 
and the conditions of the stored chemicals.  
▪Tank farms and other large storage facilities are 
often seen as ‘just storage’ and may not get the 
process safety attention they deserve.
▪The three AN incidents noted in this Beacon all 
occurred in warehouses, not tanks. Buildings 
storing chemicals also need to have functional 
process safety systems to ensure the material is 
properly stored.
▪Some materials have a shelf life –an amount of 
time where they remain safe. Beyond that time, the 
materials may degrade, become unstable and 
cause a fire or explosion. If the material is no
longer needed, have it removed for proper
disposal.
▪There have been many incidents involving hot 
work in tank farms. In many cases, the hazards of 
the materials were not recognized during the 
permit review and approval process.

January 2025 See Something, Say Something
An audit team was touring a newly installed 
load/unload station. A team member saw two hose 
reels near the station, both with the same -colored 
hose and the same connectors. One was labeled 
compressed air; the other nitrogen. A team member 
asked how the hoses were used. The air hose was 
for use with pneumatic tools and the nitrogen to inert 
tank trucks during loading. 
The team member pointed out that if those identical 
hoses were reversed, a tank truck that was 
supposed to be nitrogen -inerted could instead be in 
the flammable range. No one during the design 
reviews or the Prestart -up Safety Review identified 
this hazard. The air hose was locked out until the 
situation could be implemented and reviewed using 
MOC. A second hazard also existed. If someone 
connected nitrogen to an air -powered tool, they 
could be exposed to an oxygen -deficient 
atmosphere and pass out. 
This is an example of someone asking a simple 
question that may have prevented two potentially 
serious incidents. It emphasizes the need to speak 
up when something appears to be incorrect.▪ A weak signal is an indication that something may be 
wrong. In Figure 1, the weak signal is identical hoses and 
the potential to use the wrong one.
▪ Equipment that is making a different noise or vibrating are 
both weak signals that something is wrong and needs 
attention.
▪ Weak signals often increase until they become a strong 
signal –an equipment failure or leak that cannot be 
ignored. 
▪ Many major incidents had weak signals or warning signs 
that were ignored before the incident. After the incident, 
these signals were obvious.
▪ Notify others about a weak signal. It is better to review the 
situation and know it’s OK versus hoping it’s not important.
▪ People notice differences, but the hazard will only be 
addressed if those differences are raised to someone who 
can correct them.
▪ A poorly written procedure is also a weak signal.  They 
may be fine for an experienced operator but confuse a 
newer empl oyee. 
▪ When you see something that does not seem correct, notify 
the area supervisor. They can bring the right resources to 
review this situation and start repairs if needed.
▪ During rounds or field inspections watch for things that 
changed since your last inspection. Note them and ask 
about it.
▪ Confusing procedures should be corrected. If adding a 
diagram or picture would improve the procedure, suggest 
that to your supervisor.
▪ Watch for specific issues while in the field –open electric 
boxes, sample taps with no plug, or unreadable gauges are 
all situations that need to be corrected to prevent a possible 
incident. Did You Know?

An incident occurred on a 70 -foot (21m) tall equipment 
platform when a contractor pipefitter applied excess torque 
to tighten flange bolts on a heat exchanger outlet pipe 
containing gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl), causing the 
pipe to crack and release toxic HCl.
Seven workers from two contract firms were present on the 
platform. To escape from the HCl release, three insulators 
climbed down piping on the side of the structure; all three 
fell to the ground. One worker was fatally injured, and the 
other two sustained serious injuries.
The company described the task to the pipefitting foreman. 
They provided the manufacturer’s equipment manual 
containing the torque specification of 40 ft -lbs. for the bolts 
on the PTFE -lined piping. (Figure 1.) The manual did not 
include the lower torque requirements for the bolts 
connecting the PTFE -piping to the graphite nozzle on the 
exchanger. The company had provided the piping 
contractor with a heat exchanger drawing, that showed the 
15 ft-lb. torque requirement. The pipefitters did not have 
the design drawing with them when they performed the 
work. 
The foreman led thepipefitters to the heat exchanger to 
verbally review the tasks and indicate the specific piping 
connections they were to tighten. The workers returned to 
ground level to prepare for the work, and the foreman left 
the area. 
The different torque requirements were not clearly 
explained and led to the inadvertent over -torquing of the 
flange bolts on live operating equipment, the equipment 
fracture, and the release of HCl.▪Write clear entries in the logbook, round sheets or 
other notes. Use equipment descriptions or 
numbers and avoid abbreviations and jargon.
▪Point out critical issues and tasks, such as line 
break locations or hose connections, in the field 
with those who will perform the work.
▪Issue permits to contract workers where the work 
will be performed. The extra time taken to review 
the job together may save time andavoid an 
incident.
▪Repeat radio communications back to the sender 
to confirm you understand the message. 
▪Ask someone if you are unsure how to proceed. It 
is better to cause a slight delay than a serious 
incident.Source: CSB report

Shocking Information !!•Static discharges are frequent ignition sources for flammable 
and combustible materials. (Ref. Dec 2008 and Feb. 2021 
Beacons)
▪When two surfaces come together and then separate, an 
electrostatic charge can be transferred between those 
surfaces. This can occur during pneumatic transfer, sieving, 
milling, blending, and pouring.
▪The two surfaces can be a solid and a liquid that occurs during 
liquid transfer, mixing, filtration. It can also be two solid 
materials such as solid material flowing in or out of a container 
or flowing through piping or ductwork.
▪Static charge can also be generated by moving equipment 
such as conveyor belts moving over rollers.
▪Static discharges have warning signs:
•Sounds including a snap or crackle
•Visual signs like a bluish arc or glow
•A prickly sensation on hands or arms
▪Grounding and bonding are important safeguards to prevent 
static charge accumulation, but they must be maintained to 
be effective. (Figure 2)
▪Static accumulation can be detected using fixed or portable 
meters. Figure 2

In 2021, three contract workers at a facility in La Porte, Texas, 
were removing the actuator from a plug valve. The actuator was 
being removed so the valve could be used as an energy 
isolation device for a piping repair job. When they remove dthe 
actuator, the workers inadvertently removed pressure -retaining 
components on the valve and the pressure ejected the plug 
from the valve body. Approximately 164,000 pounds (74,545 
kg) of a corrosive and toxic mixture of glacial acetic acid and 
methyl iodide erupted from the open valve body . All three 
contractors were sprayed with the mixture. Two of the workers 
were fatally injured. Another contract worker and a company 
responder were seriously injured. Twenty -nine other people 
were transported to medical facilities for further evaluation and 
treatment. (ref CSB report No. 2021 -05-I-TX)
A similar incident occurred in Baton Rouge, LA in 2016. That 
incident caused a release of isobutane, which ignited and 
severely burned four workers . (ref CSB report No. 2016 -02-I-LA and 
CCPS Beacon, December 2021). 
These incidents had three common factors:
1. Contr actors or operators did not have a procedure for 
removing the actuator.
2. Cont ractors or operators were not trained on removing the 
actuator.
3. Other workers were in the area assisting with the actuator 
removal who could have pointed out the wrong bolts were being

On July 20, 2020, a 35 -year-old worker was fatally 
injured while working on a road construction 
project in New York state. The cause was severe 
heat illness, often called Heat Stroke. The worker 
had finished the second day of work on the 
outdoor work site when he collapsed. The high 
temperature that day was over 90º F (32º C). 
While this incident occurred at a construction site, 
it could have happened at a refinery or chemical 
plant. An operator loading a tanker in the sunlight 
or a maintenance technician welding outdoors 
could also be the victim of heat illness.

June 2025 Operational Readiness Reviews
A large plant was restarting after hydrotesting 
the steam superheater coils on a reformer 
furnace. No modification had been made to 
the coils. The locking pins on spring hangers 
for the pendant superheater were installed to 
support the extra weight of the water during 
the test. A step in the restart procedure to 
remove the pins was missed and they were 
not removed before heating was restarted. 
As the heating of the reformer furnace 
continued, the superheater coils could not 
expand due to the locked spring support. An 
operator heard an abnormal noise from the 
coil area and reported it. 
Operators halted the restart, removed the 
locking pins, and resumed the restart with no 
additional problems 
Here, there was no modification to the 
superheater coils to require a Pre -Start -up 
Safety Review (PSSR), but an Operational 
Readiness Review (ORR) could have found 
the locking pins before the start -up was 
begun.
Operational Readiness Reviews  Differ from PSSRs▪Restoring equipment to service is a dangerous activity since 
many systems may not be in their normal operating mode or 
position. Even equipment that has been off -line for a few hours 
can present hazards.
▪An Operational Readiness Review (ORR) should be conducted 
when starting equipment that has been idle, even if nothing 
was modified.
▪A Pre -Start -up Safety Review (PSSR) should verify that all 
systems are ready before starting or restarting new or modified 
equipment. A PSSR must ensure that the modification was 
completed according to design or that any changes were 
reviewed by MOC and are documented on redline drawings. 
▪Both a PSSR or ORR must be done BEFORE the hazardous 
materials are added to the system to avoid problems that could 
require clearing the system again to fix the problems.
▪The most frequent problems from poor PSSRs or ORRs are: 
drains or bleeder lines left open, wrong motor rotation, 
instruments still in bypass mode, procedures do not match the 
new/modified equipment.

A safety device can't protect you if it is bypassed!Did You Know?

July 2025
In August 2017, a major fire occurred at a refinery in the 
Netherlands when a furnace tube ruptured. The furnace 
was overheated when the process flow through it stopped, 
but the burners kept firing . With no flow, the tubes 
overheated and failed (Figure 1). Over 100 metric tons 
(110 tons) of flammable liquid were released and burned 
in the furnace. The furnace had to be replaced, which shut 
the unit down for about a year. Fortunately, no one was 
hurt. 
Several things went wrong. This Beacon will focus on just 
one –the availability and use of interlock bypass switches 
as part of operating procedures without following the 
bypass management procedure.
The company had recognized the hazard associated with 
the low -flow interlock bypass several years before and 
had programmed timers in their safety systems to remove 
the bypasses after being at low -flow for 5 minutes. But the 
company didn’t remove the field bypass switches.  
Operators felt the 5 minutes was too short, so they 
continued to use the field -mounted bypass switches 
without using the company’s bypass management 
procedure. The system was in manual bypass when the 
incident occurred.
After the accident, the refinery technical staff studied the 
timers and concluded that 5 minutes was, in fact, 
sufficient. They also changed all their non -timed bypass 
switches to require supervisor keys. ▪Bypass switches on safety interlocks are 
occasionally needed. In this case, a low -flow 
Interlock stopped the burner gas. If an interlock 
bypass is needed for start -up, an interlock timer 
can ensure the interlock isn’t left in bypass 
longer than needed.
▪Another key interlock on gas -fired equipment is 
the pre -ignition purge timer. Bypassing this 
timer has caused many firebox explosions and 
fatalities.
▪Many companies use a bypass permit or a 
temporary MOC to manage bypassing controls. 
These systems require a hazard review and 
approval by an authorized person.
▪Many events were caused by improper use of 
interlock bypasses. Some noted in past 
Beacons are June 2003, June 2013, and 
February 2019.
▪When participating in hazard reviews:
▪Point out where interlock bypasses 
are used for getting the unit started or 
for any other purposes. 
▪In particular, discuss interlocks that 
can be manually bypassed.  
▪If bypass timers are used, ask, ’are the 
time-limits reasonable?’ They should 
be long enough to get started, without 
being so long that anincident could 
happen.
▪Systems in bypass should be noted in the unit 
logbook and discussed during shift handover.An Interlock bypass bites againwww.aiche.org/ccps/process -safety -beacon

August 2025 Thermal Expansion runs hotandcold!
Too hot or too cold can be a bad “break” for your equipment▪Matter normally expands when temperature rises. This 
is because its molecules or atoms move more and 
occupy more space. 
▪The gas phase of any material has a much larger 
volume than its solid or liquid phases. A gas is matter 
that occupies a lot of empty space. A gas can easily be 
compressed which reduces the empty space. 
▪For gases like air, a temperature increase from 32 °F 
(0 °C) to 523 °F (273 °C) doubles the volume. If no 
additional volume is available in the pipe or container, 
the pressure doubles.
▪Liquids and solids have tightly packed molecules and 
atoms and even very high pressure cannot compress 
them much. When heated, they expand; liquids much 
more than solids. Pipelines in hot service have 
compensating expansion loops and liquids blocked -in 
without a gas space or relief device can rupture 
equipment as is shown in Figure 1.
▪Water expands by nine percent on solidifying 
(freezing). This effect makes ice float, bursts water 
bottles in a freezer ‒and it ruptured the elbow in the 
propane piping in Figure 2. Did You Know?

No. 2019 -02-I-TX). Right, ruptured strainer (CSB), from red 
circle in schematic.
In April 2019, at a facility producing specialty 
chemicals, a piping section filled with liquid 
isobutene was closed off. As its temperature 
slowly increased, a cast -iron strainer burst, 
leaving a hand -sized hole. The release was 
followed by an explosion and fire, injuring 31, 
one of them fatally, and causing enormous 
damage. See the May and July 2024 Beacons.
In February 2007, at a refinery, a section of 
piping cracked and released pressurized 
propane. That section had been out -of-service 
for 15 years but was still connected to active 
piping. The resulting fire injured four and 
caused huge material losses. One leaking 
block valve allowed small quantities of water, 
contained in the propane feed, to collect in a 
low part of the seemingly blocked -off section. 
Cold temperatures caused the water to freeze 
and split the pipe. When the ice thawed, 
propane escaped. (See the October 2008
Beacon )▪When you notice parts of equipment that are not 
rigidly fixed, it may be to compensate for thermal 
expansion. Do not try to correct it; point it out to your 
supervisor. 
▪Do not block in hoses or pipes that are filled with 
liquid, if this is exposed to sunlight or heat, unless 
there is a relief device. This is easily overlooked 
during troubleshooting activities. Follow established 
procedures for isolating and depressurizing.
▪If ambient temperatures can drop below 32 °F (0°C),  
check that where the piping could contain water is 
freezeproofed. The freezing point of other materials 
may require freezeproofing at different temperatures.

Several errors lead to a hydrogen leak & fire
A  release of high -pressure hydrogen occurred at a hydrogen 
trailer transfer/filling facility in Santa Clara, California, on June 1, 
2019. 
A driver and trainee were filling a tube trailer from a hydrogen tank 
nearby. When the trailer modules were about 95% full, the trainee 
noticed a hydrogen leak near the fill line manual isolation valve 
and informed the driver. The driver instructed the trainee to stop 
the filling operation. The trainee stopped the filling process for 
both modules but did not disconnect the trailer from the fill system 
piping. (Figure 1) The driver closed the manual valve (arrow) to 
isolate the front module from the supply, depressurized the fill 
manifold, and removed a piping section to repair the leak. The 
driver did not have the parts to complete the repair and instructed 
the trainee to shut off the hydrogen supply. The trainee 
inadvertently restarted the filling process by pressing the wrong 
control button. This opened pneumatic valves on the trailer 
allowing gaseous hydrogen to escape at a high flow rate through 
the disassembled piping. The hydrogen -air mixture ignited and 
resulted in a hydrogen -air deflagration explosion followed by a jet 
fire.
The fire and explosion caused piping damage (Figure 2) and 
activated the hydrogen temperature -pressure relief devices, 
adding fuel to the incident. The fire spread to other materials on 
adjacent vehicles. Approximately 250 kg (550lbs) of hydrogen was 
released during this event. There were no serious injuries .▪Hydrogen is the smallest molecule and can 
leak through very small gaps.
▪The ignition energy of hydrogen is 0.02mJ. 
By comparison, natural gas has an ignition 
energy of 0.29mJ.
▪Piping systems can be complex and may 
require a diagram and procedure to 
properly isolate it. 
▪Repairs should only be attempted when the 
equipment is properly isolated from the 
hazards and only performed  by authorized 
personnel.
▪Repairs to hazardous material piping must 
follow approved procedures and methods.
▪Stop work authority allows employees to 
halt a job if they do not have the training or 
procedures to safely perform a task. Figure 1. Filling a hydrogen

▪Use the isolation or Lockout -Tagout 
(LOTO) procedures for the equipment. 
Before opening any connections, inspect 
the piping to confirm all valves are in the 
correct position
▪When a leak occurs, follow the company’s 
leak procedure. If possible, safely isolate 
the leak , and notify the correct people.
▪Process controls should be easily 
understood. If control  labels are hard to

▪Repair process equipment only if you are 
trained and approved.
▪When working with a newer employee, 
provide clear instructions for the assigned 
tasks. It is better to show them the correct 
way than to only tell them.
When leaks occur, follow the procedures and ask for assistance.

October 2025 Refinery Cooling Tower Explosion and Fire
In August 2013, a refinery in India was commissioning a new 
cooling tower cell. As process water was introduced into the 
new cell for the first time, a large quantity of light hydrocarbon 
liquid and vapor was released. It ignited, likely by hot work in 
the area. In all, 29 people were fatally injured and many more 
sustained burn injuries. 
The investigators concluded that flammable hydrocarbons from 
a leaking heat exchanger had collected in a high point in the 
cooling water piping. This piping section had no flow until 
Valve ‘A’  (Figure 2) was opened to commission the new 
cooling tower cell. Flammable fluid from the leaking exchanger 
was released into the cooling tower. A large cloud formed in 
and around the cooling tower and ignited. Many of the injured 
were contractors working in the area at the time. The 
company’s practice of stopping work when commissioning new 
equipment was not followed.▪Most hydrocarbons are lighter than water 
and can accumulate in high points.
▪Tubes in shell -and-tube heat exchangers 
have much thinner walls than piping. A 
small amount of corrosion can weaken 
them and cause leaks.
▪Heat exchanger tubes are difficult to 
inspect since they are inside the shell. 
▪Start -up or recommissioning can create 
hazardous situations since some safety 
systems may be absent or disabled and 
there may be additional people working in 
the area.
▪Cooling towers are sometimes built with 
wood or fiberglass internal structures. In a 
fire, these materials can be difficult to 
extinguish.
▪Cooling towers are often seen as a low 
hazard process since they “only” process 
water. 
▪Cooling tower design may include safety 
features to help protect against this hazard 
such as vapor disengaging vents, gas 
detectors, and sprinkler protection.Figure 1. Cooling tower fire Did You Know?

▪Process fluids can leak into cooling water. 
Never assume the cooling water system is 
‘just water’.
▪When opening, or starting the flow in cooling 
water lines, consider what could be inside 
the pipes and what could leak out. 
▪During start -ups, hazardous materials can 
be released. Alert nearby workers of the 
situation so they can pause their work and
leave the area until it is safe to resume their 
work.Fig 2. Sketch of Cooling Water linesA

November 2025 PPE only works when you wear it correctly!
On May 4, 2023, approximately 790 pounds (358Kg) of a 
hydrocarbon mixture containing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was 
accidentally released at a refinery in California. Exposure to the 
toxic H2S gas seriously injured one employee.
Four operators were sent to the field to replace a broken pressure 
gauge. Because the lower valve (blue oval) was visibly broken, 
the operators closed the valve closest to the pressure gauge 
(blue rectangle). They were not aware that an internal obstruction 
prevented fully closing the valve. One  operator began removing 
the pressure gauge; there was no indication of residual pressure 
while unscrewing the gauge. After the gauge was removed, the 
process pressure likely dislodged debris in the piping and 
released flammable hydrocarbon mixture containing toxic 
hydrogen sulfide. None of the operators wore respirators to 
protect them from the H2S vapor. Three operators regained 
consciousness and evacuated. The fourth operator was 
unconscious and was rescued by emergency responders and tor 
received medical treatment at a hospital. 
The investigation determined that the release was caused by  
failure to effectively isolate the piping before removing the 
pressure gauge. The plugged gauge gave a false sense of safety  
The severity  of the incident was increased by the failure of the 
operators to wear appropriate personal protective equipment 
(PPE). 
Take care of your PPE and it will take care of you.▪PPE is an administrative safeguard that 
requires people to know the proper PPE for 
the job, and to ensure it is worn properly. It 
includes protection from bodily and 
respiratory exposures. 
▪Operating and maintenance procedures 
should specify the PPE required to safely 
perform the task. 
▪Safety Data Sheets (SDS) have a section on 
recommended PPE. 
▪There are several reasons why PPE might 
not be effective: 
•It is not used or not used 
properly.
•User is not properly trained on 
using the PPE.
•The specified PPE is not correct 
for the task.
•The task changed. 
•The PPE is in poor condition.
▪PPE cannot prevent the release of 
hazardous materials but is a critical line of 
defense when a loss of containment occurs. 
▪Before starting a task consult the procedure 
to know what PPE that is required. The SDS 
for the materials can also provide guidance 
on proper PPE.
▪Inspect your PPE before use to ensure it is 
in good condition.
▪Wear the required PPE until the task is 
completed and the hazards are contained.
▪Inspect your PPE regularly to ensure that it 
remains in good condition and key parts 
such as respirator cartridges are not 
expired.Figure1. Valves isolating the

On May 4, 2023, approximately 790 pounds (358Kg) of a 
hydrocarbon mixture containing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was 
accidentally released at a refinery in California. Exposure to the 
toxic H2S gas seriously injured one employee.
Four operators were sent to the field to replace a broken pressure 
gauge. Because the lower valve (blue oval) was visibly broken, 
the operators closed the valve closest to the pressure gauge 
(blue rectangle). They were not aware that an internal obstruction 
prevented fully closing the valve. One operator began removing 
the pressure gauge; there was no indication of residual pressure 
while unscrewing the gauge. After the gauge was removed, the 
process pressure likely dislodged debris in the piping and 
released flammable hydrocarbon mixture containing toxic 
hydrogen sulfide. None of the operators wore respirators to 
protect them from the H2S vapor. Three operators regained 
consciousness and evacuated. The fourth operator was 
unconscious and was rescued by emergency responders and 
received medical treatment at a hospital. 
The investigation determined that the release was caused by 
failure to effectively isolate the piping before removing the 
pressure gauge. The plugged gauge gave a false sense of safety. 
The severity of the incident was increased by the failure of the 
operators to wear appropriate personal protective equipment 
(PPE). 
Take care of your PPE and it will take care of you.▪PPE is an administrative safeguard that 
requires people to know the proper PPE for 
the job, and to ensure it is worn properly. It 
includes protection from bodily and 
respiratory exposures. 
▪Operating and maintenance procedures 
should specify the PPE required to safely 
perform the task. 
▪Safety Data Sheets (SDS) have a section on 
recommended PPE. 
▪There are several reasons why PPE might 
not be effective: 
•It is not used or not used 
properly.
•User is not properly trained on 
using the PPE.
•The specified PPE is not correct 
for the task.
•The task changed. 
•The PPE is in poor condition.
▪PPE cannot prevent the release of 
hazardous materials but is a critical line of 
defense when a loss of containment occurs. 
▪Before starting a task consult the procedure 
to know what PPE that is required. The SDS 
for the materials can also provide guidance 
on proper PPE.
▪Inspect your PPE before use to ensure it is 
in good condition.
▪Wear the required PPE until the task is 
completed and the hazards are contained.
▪Inspect your PPE regularly to ensure that it 
remains in good condition and key parts 
such as respirator cartridges are not 
expired.Figure1. Valves isolating the

December 2025 Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) events start an incident
Prevent LOPC -keep hazardous materials in the right place!▪While making rounds watch for leaks and 
promptly report them. 
▪Place barricades around leaks until the 
leaking material is identified and the leak is 
stopped.
▪Report missing or damaged insulation.
▪Point out leaks that occur in the same place 
or with the same material. They may 
indicate a weak point in the system or a 
bigger problem.
▪Share LOPC events during Process Hazard 
Analyses (PHAs) What Can You Do?This issue sponsored by

January 2014 
Process safety incidents occur in operations of all sizes, in the petrochemical industries and many other operations 
that handle chemicals. One thing many process incidents have in common; they start with a Loss of Primary 
Containment (LOPC) event. Here are 3 past Beacons that demonstrate this fact:
Corrosion can be hidden cause  of LOPC. The January 2014 Beacon shows how insulation can hide and promote 
corrosion under insulation (CUI). (https://ccps.aiche.org/resources/process -safety -beacon/archives?page=3) 
Poor isolation of piping and equipment is a frequent cause of LOPC events. The Beacon from October 2021 covers 
an incident where poor isolation fatally injured 2 people. (https://ccps.aiche.org/resources/process -safety -
beacon/archives?page=2)
Releases of hazardous material can also be caused by mixing incompatible materials. The May 2023 Beacon points 
out an example of where adding the wrong material to a tank can have huge impacts.

Did You Know?
▪A Loss of Primary Containment is an unplanned or 
uncontrolled release of material from primary containment.
▪Loss of Primary Containment events often have warning 
signs such as severe corrosion or terminal valves in 
hazardous service not capped or plugged.
▪LOPC is caused by many factors other than those listed 
above such as: vehicle strikes, mechanical damage, 
vibration, mis -operation, wrong material of construction, 
temperature or pressure changes, among others.
▪Damaged insulation allows water into the insulation and 
can cause CUI;
▪LOPC events are preventable!"
